# Kaku - AI Writing Assistant Project Status

## Latest Updates (March 22, 2024)
We've made significant UI improvements to create a Claude-like experience. Some issues remain to be addressed:

1. ✅ Fixed sidebar hover functionality with translucent blue styling when open
2. ✅ Enhanced document panel with:
   - Completely hidden when not in use
   - Document cards layout for selection
   - Improved document viewing experience with better fonts
   - Navigation between document list and individual documents
3. ✅ Added header controls with:
   - Star button for favoriting conversations
   - Share button for sharing content
   - Document panel toggle
4. ✅ Updated color scheme to use dark grays instead of pure black

## Identified UI Issues to Fix (March 22, 2024)
1. ⚠️ Tooltip popup text is getting cut off - tooltips should be removed
2. ⚠️ Document panel navigation needs improvements (back button functionality)
3. ⚠️ Sidebar closes unexpectedly when moving cursor - needs stability improvements
4. ⚠️ Background colors still too dark - need to lighten by ~10%

Next steps will focus on fixing these UI issues before progressing to authentication testing and core RAG functionality implementation.
