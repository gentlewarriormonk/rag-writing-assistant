## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Authentication Problems
- **Issue**: GitHub asks for credentials repeatedly
- **Solution**: Use a personal access token or set up SSH keys (we can provide instructions if needed)

- **Solution**: Use Cursor's merge conflict resolution tools or let us know for guidance

### File Not Saving
- **Issue**: Changes aren't being saved
- **Solution**: Check if the file is read-only or if you have permission to write to the directory
