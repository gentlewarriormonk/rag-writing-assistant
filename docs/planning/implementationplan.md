## Cursor Implementation Strategy

### Working with Cursor for Each Component

For each component implementation in Cursor, follow this pattern:

1. **Authentication Components** (First Priority)
   ```
   1. Define component and props with TypeScript
   2. Implement security checks and validations
   3. Create UI with selected color scheme
   4. Add error handling and feedback
   5. Write unit tests
   ```

2. **Core Utility Functions** (Second Priority)
   ```
   1. Define function signature with TypeScript
   2. Implement security measures
   3. Add comprehensive error handling
   4. Write unit tests
   ```

3. **Feature Components** (After Authentication)
   ```
   1. Define component with authorization requirements
   2. Implement UI with selected color scheme
   3. Add API integration with security headers
   4. Implement error boundaries
   5. Add form validation if applicable
   ```

### Code Chunk Size Guidelines for Cursor

- Keep individual files under 300 lines for optimal Cursor performance
- Split complex components into sub-components
- Group related functionality into logical modules
- Use consistent naming conventions for security-related functions

### Testing Strategy in Cursor

- Implement unit tests alongside components
- Create security-focused test cases
- Test error handling extensively
- Use mock data that follows security best practices
