# Landing Page Technology Recommendations

## Context

The Kaku landing page needs to implement the "Cosmic Landing Sequence" described in the First-Time User Experience document, including a starfield animation, interactive scroll journey, and character introduction. This landing page must integrate seamlessly with the main application codebase.

## Recommended Technologies

### Core Framework
- **Next.js**: For seamless integration with the React-based application
  - Benefits: Server-side rendering capabilities, optimized performance, TypeScript support
  - Ensures consistent technology stack with the main application
  - Simplified routing system for the multi-stage onboarding flow

### Animation Libraries
1. **Three.js**: For the cosmic starfield and Earth animation
   - Benefits: Powerful 3D rendering for space environment
   - Can create immersive, interactive space scenes
   - Well-documented with many examples for space visualization

2. **Framer Motion**: For character animations and scroll interactions
   - Benefits: React-native integration, declarative animations
   - Excellent for scroll-based animations and transitions
   - Supports gesture interactions for mobile experience

3. **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: For complex animation sequences
   - Benefits: Precise timeline control for the landing sequence
   - Exceptional browser compatibility
   - Handles complex animation chains for the character introduction

### Scroll Interaction
- **Locomotive Scroll** or **React Scroll Parallax**: For the interactive scroll journey
  - Benefits: Smooth scrolling experience across devices
  - Parallax effects for cosmic elements
  - Trigger-based animations as user progresses through the story

### Visual Assets
- **SVG Animations**: For Kaku's character movements and expressions
  - Benefits: Scalable, lightweight, programmable animations
  - Can express emotional states through color and movement
  - Better performance than video-based approaches

- **Lottie**: For more complex character animations if needed
  - Benefits: Supports more sophisticated animation sequences
  - Excellent performance for complex movements
  - Can be exported directly from After Effects

### Sound Design
- **Howler.js**: For ambient cosmic sounds and interaction feedback
  - Benefits: Comprehensive audio library with good performance
  - Handles multiple audio sprites and background sounds
  - Cross-browser compatible with fallbacks

## Integration Approach

### 1. Component Structure
- Create a standalone landing module within the existing application
- Structure as independent components that can be imported into the main app
- Use a shared design system for visual consistency

### 2. State Management
- Implement simple state management for tracking onboarding progress
- Store onboarding completion status to prevent repeated viewing for returning users
- Use context API or simple state hooks rather than complex state management

### 3. Build Process
- Ensure the landing page assets are optimized during build
- Implement code splitting to load landing assets only when needed
- Configure proper caching strategies for static assets

### 4. Transition to Main Application
- Design a smooth handoff from landing experience to sign-up
- Implement authentication flow that maintains narrative continuity
- Create seamless transition to the main chat interface

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Performance Budget**
   - Prioritize initial load performance (target < 2s for first meaningful paint)
   - Progressively load animation assets as needed
   - Optimize for mobile devices with potentially limited resources

2. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure the experience is accessible for users with disabilities
   - Provide alternative text-based journey for screen readers
   - Include options to reduce motion for vestibular sensitivity

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Create tailored experiences for different device types
   - Optimize animations for touch interactions on mobile
   - Ensure the cosmic journey works across device orientations

4. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Test across major browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
   - Implement fallbacks for browsers without WebGL support
   - Ensure core experience works even with JS limitations

## Integration with Main Codebase

To ensure the landing page can be added to the existing codebase:

1. **Folder Structure**
   ```
   /src
     /landing
       /components
       /animations
       /hooks
       /utils
       /assets
       index.js  // Main landing page entry point
   ```

2. **Route Configuration**
   - Add routes in the main application for landing experience
   - Implement conditional rendering based on user authentication status
   - Create router guards to direct new vs. returning users

3. **Shared Resources**
   - Utilize shared design tokens and theme variables
   - Access global auth context for user status
   - Leverage existing utility functions where applicable

4. **Development Workflow**
   - The landing page can be developed in isolation first
   - Use Storybook for component development and testing
   - Integrate with main application once core functionality is complete

## Recommended Development Sequence

1. Create basic Next.js page structure with routing
2. Implement starfield background with Three.js
3. Develop scroll journey framework with content placeholders
4. Create Kaku character animations and interactions
5. Implement sound design and audio interactions
6. Develop sign-up transition and authentication flow
7. Optimize performance and implement accessibility features
8. Test across devices and browsers before integration
