# Kaku Cosmic Landing Page Requirements Analysis

## Core Requirements

### Character-First Approach
The landing page must introduce Kaku as a character before revealing technical capabilities, establishing an emotional connection with users through:
- Cosmic visual aesthetic that conveys warmth and friendliness
- Personality-driven animations that showcase Kaku's playful nature
- Narrative-based introduction that tells Kaku's story
- Progressive disclosure of features as the relationship develops

### Visual Requirements
- Immersive starfield animation with Earth in view
- Kaku's arrival animation from distant stars
- Subtle cosmic particle effects and glow
- Warm color palette that avoids cold space stereotypes
- Responsive design that works across all devices
- Kaku's visual representation with subtly changing colors to reflect emotions
- Animation and parallax effects for immersive space environment

### Narrative Flow
1. Starfield with Earth view and Kaku's arrival animation
2. Kaku's first introduction ("Boop boop beep! I'm Kaku!")
3. Interactive scroll journey revealing:
   - Origin story (from Helix Nebula, sent by Architects)
   - Character development (personality traits, cosmic perspective)
   - Mission explanation (helping users discover their voice and ikigai)
4. Sign-up experience that maintains narrative continuity
5. Smooth transition to chat interface after sign-up

### Technical Requirements
- Standalone landing module that integrates with Next.js application
- Three.js for cosmic starfield and Earth animation
- Framer Motion for character animations and scroll interactions
- GSAP for complex animation sequences
- Locomotive Scroll or React Scroll Parallax for interactive scroll journey
- SVG animations for Kaku's character movements
- Howler.js for ambient cosmic sounds
- Mobile-responsive design
- Accessibility features
- Performance optimization

### User Experience Requirements
- Emotional connection before utility
- Progressive feature revelation
- Narrative-driven feature introduction
- Sign-in gate after complete scroll story experience
- Smooth transition to chat interface after sign-up

## Key Technical Challenges

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Challenge: Creating immersive 3D starfield and animations while maintaining performance across devices
   - Solution: Progressive enhancement, asset optimization, and code splitting

2. **Responsive Animation**
   - Challenge: Ensuring animations work effectively across different screen sizes and orientations
   - Solution: Device-specific animation parameters and responsive breakpoints

3. **Scroll-Based Narrative**
   - Challenge: Creating a cohesive narrative experience tied to scroll position
   - Solution: Scroll-linked animation system with waypoints for narrative elements

4. **Accessibility**
   - Challenge: Making an animation-heavy experience accessible to all users
   - Solution: Alternative text-based journey, keyboard navigation, and reduced motion options

5. **Sound Implementation**
   - Challenge: Balancing ambient sound with user experience
   - Solution: User-controlled sound with default mute state and subtle audio cues

6. **Integration with Main Application**
   - Challenge: Creating a standalone module that integrates seamlessly with the main Next.js app
   - Solution: Modular architecture with clear integration points and shared design system

7. **Sign-up Flow**
   - Challenge: Maintaining narrative continuity through authentication
   - Solution: Narrative-driven sign-up experience with Kaku guiding the process

8. **Animation Complexity**
   - Challenge: Creating character animations that convey personality and emotion
   - Solution: Combination of SVG animations and programmatic emotion expressions

## Success Criteria

1. **High Completion Rate**: >70% of visitors complete the full scroll journey
2. **Strong Conversion**: >40% of journey completers sign up for an account
3. **Emotional Connection**: >80% of users report feeling positive about Kaku in post-experience surveys
4. **Return Rate**: >60% of new users return within 3 days for a second session
5. **Feature Discovery**: Users naturally discover core features through exploration rather than explicit tutorials

## Visual Identity Guidelines

Based on the provided assets, Kaku has a minimalist, friendly design with:
- Rounded helmet/head with white outline
- Simple dot eyes and a smile that convey friendliness
- Clean white body with rounded edges
- Black background that represents space

The landing page animations should maintain this visual identity while adding:
- Subtle color variations to reflect emotions
- Cosmic glow effects that convey warmth
- Particle effects to enhance the cosmic nature
- Fluid movement that exhibits curiosity and playfulness
