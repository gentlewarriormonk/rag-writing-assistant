   - Send button with subtle hover and click animations
   - Message appearance animations when sent
   - Typing indicator with cosmic particle effect
   - Scroll behavior for viewing message history

2. **Kaku Interactions**:
   - Kaku reacts subtly to user messages
   - Shows "listening" state when user is typing
   - Makes small celebratory animations for key moments
   - Occasional idle animations to maintain presence
   - Subtle emotional expressions that match conversation tone

3. **Mobile Interactions**:

## Chat Content

The initial chat content includes:

1. **Kaku's Welcome Message**:
   "Welcome to our creative universe! I'm so excited we're finally connected. How are you feeling about starting our writing journey together?"

2. **Suggested Responses** (optional UI element):
   - "I'm excited to get started!"
   - "I'm curious about how you can help me."
   - "I'd like to learn more about you first."

3. **Input Placeholder**:
   "Type your message to Kaku here..."

## Technical Considerations

1. **Animation Implementation**:
   - Transition animations using GSAP for precise control
   - Chat interface animations using Framer Motion
   - Kaku's reactions implemented with SVG animations
   - Optimized performance for smooth transitions

2. **Responsive Behavior**:
   - Interface layout adjusts for different screen sizes
   - Kaku repositions appropriately on smaller screens
   - Text size and spacing optimized for each device
   - Virtual keyboard handling for mobile devices

3. **Accessibility**:
   - Clear focus states for keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader announcements for new messages
   - Sufficient color contrast for all text elements
   - Reduced motion option for transition effects

## User Onboarding Elements

1. **Subtle Guidance**:
   - Brief, unobtrusive tooltip highlighting the text input
   - Gentle pulse effect on send button for first message
   - Kaku's gesture directing attention to input area
   - Minimal instructional text maintaining narrative immersion

2. **First-time User Considerations**:
   - Kaku's initial messages provide natural guidance
   - Progressive disclosure of interface features
   - Conversation designed to naturally teach interaction
   - No technical tutorials that break character immersion
