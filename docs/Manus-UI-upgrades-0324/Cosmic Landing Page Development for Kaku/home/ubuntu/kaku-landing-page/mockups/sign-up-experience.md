   - React form with proper validation hooks
   - Accessible form controls with ARIA attributes
   - Secure handling of authentication data
   - Smooth error handling and feedback

2. **Responsive Behavior**:
   - Form layout adjusts for different screen sizes
   - Input field size optimized for each device type
   - Kaku repositions appropriately on smaller screens
   - Virtual keyboard handling for mobile devices

3. **Accessibility**:
   - Clear focus states for keyboard navigation
   - Error messages linked to appropriate fields
   - Sufficient color contrast for all text
   - Screen reader support for all form elements

## Transition to Next Screen

This screen transitions to the Chat Interface when:
1. User successfully completes and submits the sign-up form

The transition occurs with:
1. A celebratory animation from Kaku
2. The form transforming/dissolving into cosmic particles
3. A smooth transition effect suggesting "entering" Kaku's space
4. Kaku leading the way into the chat interface
5. Welcoming text appearing that references the completed journey
