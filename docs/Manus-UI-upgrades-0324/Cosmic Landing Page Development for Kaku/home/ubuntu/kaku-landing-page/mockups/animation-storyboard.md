## Mobile-Specific Transition Adaptations

**General Adaptations:**
- Transition durations reduced by 15-20% for mobile
- Simplified particle effects for performance
- More vertical-oriented motion paths
- Touch feedback incorporated into transitions

**Key Mobile Adjustments:**
1. **Starfield to Kaku:** Simplified arrival path optimized for vertical viewport
2. **Introduction to Origin:** More direct vertical transition with less parallax
3. **Between Scroll Sections:** Snap points for clearer section transitions
4. **Sign-up to Chat:** Adjusted for virtual keyboard considerations

## Technical Implementation Notes

1. **Scroll-Linked Animations:**
   - Use Intersection Observer API for trigger points
   - GSAP ScrollTrigger for precise scroll-based timing
   - Scroll snap points on mobile for cleaner section transitions

2. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Preload critical animation assets
   - Reduce animation complexity based on device capability
   - Use hardware acceleration for smoother transitions
   - Implement reduced motion alternatives

3. **State Management:**
   - Track transition states to handle interruptions
   - Allow transitions to be gracefully interrupted by user interaction
   - Ensure animations complete properly if scrolling is rapid

4. **Accessibility:**
   - Provide skip animation options
   - Honor reduced motion preferences
   - Ensure narrative continuity is maintained in non-animated version
