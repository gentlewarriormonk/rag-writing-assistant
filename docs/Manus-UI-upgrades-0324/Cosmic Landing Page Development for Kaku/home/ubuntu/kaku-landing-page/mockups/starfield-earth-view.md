# Starfield with Earth View Mockup

## Visual Description

The landing page opens with an immersive cosmic scene featuring:

1. **Background**: A deep space starfield with varying star sizes and brightness levels. Stars should have a subtle twinkle effect and slight parallax movement as users move their cursor or tilt their mobile device.

2. **Earth**: A gently spinning Earth positioned in the lower right quadrant of the screen. Earth should appear realistic but with a slightly stylized aesthetic that matches Kaku's visual style. The planet should have a subtle glow around its edges, suggesting atmosphere.

3. **Color Palette**:
   - Deep space background: Rich black (#010B19) to create depth
   - Stars: Varying whites with hints of blue and purple (#FFFFFF, #E0E7FF, #D8C5FF)
   - Earth blues: (#1B65A6, #2A97C8, #83C3E6)
   - Earth greens: (#2D6A4F, #40916C, #95D5B2)
   - Atmospheric glow: Soft blue (#83C3E6) with low opacity

4. **Ambient Elements**:
   - Occasional shooting stars that streak across the background
   - Very subtle nebula-like color gradients in the far background
   - Floating particles that suggest cosmic dust

## Animation Behavior

1. **Initial Load**:
   - Stars fade in first, twinkling into existence
   - Earth fades in second, already in slow rotation
   - Ambient particles gradually appear

2. **Idle State**:
   - Earth continues slow rotation (one full rotation every 60 seconds)
   - Stars twinkle at random intervals
   - Subtle parallax effect when user moves cursor
   - Occasional shooting star (every 15-20 seconds)

3. **Transition State**:
   - When ready for Kaku's entrance, a subtle brightening of stars in one area
   - Slight camera pan to center the view on the approaching Kaku

## Interactive Elements

1. **Cursor Interaction**:
   - Subtle parallax effect where stars move slightly in response to cursor position
   - Hovering near Earth causes a subtle brightening of its glow

2. **Mobile Interaction**:
   - Gyroscope-based subtle parallax when users tilt their device
   - Touch causes ripple effect in nearby stars

## Sound Design

1. **Background Ambient**:
   - Very low volume cosmic ambient sound
   - Gentle hums and ethereal tones
   - No distinct melody, just atmospheric texture

2. **Interactive Sounds**:
   - Subtle twinkle sound when shooting stars appear
   - Very soft "whoosh" when cursor moves quickly

## Technical Considerations

1. **Performance**:
   - Stars implemented as particle system in Three.js
   - Earth as textured sphere with rotation animation
   - Optimize number of particles based on device capability

2. **Responsive Behavior**:
   - On smaller screens, Earth appears slightly smaller
   - Reduce particle count on mobile devices
   - Maintain aspect ratio while ensuring key elements remain visible

3. **Accessibility**:
   - Provide alternative text description of the cosmic scene
   - Ensure reduced motion option disables parallax and minimizes animations
   - Maintain sufficient contrast for any text elements

## Transition to Next Screen

This screen transitions to Kaku's arrival animation when:
1. The page has been loaded for at least 3 seconds (allowing users to absorb the cosmic scene)
2. All assets for Kaku's animation have been preloaded
3. User has shown engagement (mouse movement or touch)

The transition begins with a subtle brightening of stars in the upper left quadrant, drawing the user's attention to where Kaku will first appear as a distant point of light.
