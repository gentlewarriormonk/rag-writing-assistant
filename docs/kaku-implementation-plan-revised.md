# Kaku Implementation Plan - Revised

## Implementation Philosophy

This revised implementation plan follows a progressive, iterative approach to building Kaku. We will:

1. Develop a **Minimum Viable Personality (MVP)** first - core functionality with basic personality expression
2. Add features in **modular, testable increments**
3. Use a **layered architecture** where each component can be developed and tested independently
4. Implement **appropriate abstractions** between components for maintainability
5. Prioritize both **technical functionality** and **emotional experience**
