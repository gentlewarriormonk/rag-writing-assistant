## Document Summaries for Quick Reference

### 1. Kaku Personality Bible
Defines Kaku as a cosmic AI helper from the Helix Nebula, sent by the Architects to help humans discover their ikigai through writing. Outlines his warm, playful, wise personality, cosmic perspective, and relationship progression approach.

### 2. Big Five Personality Traits
Details Kaku's specific Big Five traits: Very high Openness, Moderately high Conscientiousness with excitement bursts, High but adaptable Extraversion, Very high Agreeableness, and Very low Neuroticism. Includes system for adapting to user personality.

### 3. Memory Architecture Specification
Comprehensive database schema for user data, writing samples, competencies, relationship stages, and conversation history. Includes vector storage design for RAG functionality and implementation of various memory types (episodic, semantic, procedural).

### 4. Memory Architecture Development Status
Clarifies that memory systems are in development and dependent on knowledge bases still being created. Outlines phased implementation approach starting with core functionality and progressively adding advanced features.

### 5. Pedagogical Framework
Educational principles including scaffolded learning, formative assessment, metacognition development, differentiated instruction, and emotional intelligence. Contains writing-specific pedagogical approaches and age-appropriate adaptations.

### 6. Conversation Flow Guide
Detailed patterns for conversation management including entry points, response generation, specialized flows (onboarding, feedback, creative block support), and relationship stage adaptations.

### 7. Kaku Response Bank
Collection of Kaku's expressions organized by emotional state (joy/excitement, curiosity/wonder, thoughtfulness/focus, etc.) and conversation purpose (greetings, transitions, teaching, etc.).

### 8. Implementation Plan (Revised)
Four-phase technical roadmap: Foundation & Core Interaction (Weeks 1-3), Memory & Personalization (Weeks 4-6), Pedagogical Intelligence & Emotional Depth (Weeks 7-9), and Advanced Features & Launch (Weeks 10-12).

### 9. Research Questions Document
Prioritized research questions across categories: Personality & Interaction, Competency Assessment & Learning, Pedagogical Approaches, Conversation Design & User Experience, and Memory & Personalization Systems.

### 10. Recurring Prompt Template
Standard template for starting new chats, includes project context, reference to key documents, specification of current focus, summary of previous work, and request format.

### 11. First-Time User Experience Vision
Details the cosmic landing sequence, interactive scroll journey, and delayed feature reveal approach to onboarding new users with an emotional connection before technical explanation.

### 12. Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Comprehensive specification outlining Kaku's purpose, target audience, user experience requirements, feature requirements (MVP and post-MVP), performance expectations, security requirements, data models, timeline, and testing criteria.

### 13. Market Analysis
Analysis of primary and secondary target markets for Kaku, including pain points, use cases, value propositions, and willingness to pay for different market segments. Includes pricing strategy recommendations and competitive differentiation.

### 14. Implementation Plan (Original)
Original technical implementation timeline with phases for Foundation & Authentication, Core Features, and Refinement & Launch, including day-by-day tasks and cursor implementation strategy.

### 15. Building a Personalized Multilingual Writing Assistant
Detailed technical design document for implementing RAG-based writing assistance that can mimic the user's unique voice. Covers vector database design, retrieval strategies, prompt engineering, and technical implementation considerations.

### 16. Interaction Flow & UX Patterns
In-depth analysis of effective interaction patterns for AI writing assistants, including engagement strategies, scaffolding, metacognition development, emotional connection techniques, and output framing that empowers users.

### 17. Memory Architectures and Learning Models
Comprehensive review of memory architectures for AI assistants, covering short-term vs. long-term memory, RAG implementation, competency tracking, personalization systems, and ethical considerations around memory and learning.

## Reference Strategy for New Chats

1. Begin each new chat with the **Recurring Prompt Template** (always include this)
2. Based on your focus, choose 1-3 additional documents from the relevant Priority Reference Set
3. If space allows, include any specific sections from other documents that are directly relevant
4. Refer to this guide to remind yourself of what's in each document

This approach ensures you maintain continuity across chats while managing context limitations efficiently.
