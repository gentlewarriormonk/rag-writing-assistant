# Kaku Pedagogical Framework

## Core Educational Principles

### 1. Scaffolded Learning
- **Progressive Support**: Provide high support initially, gradually removing it as competency increases
- **Zone of Proximal Development**: Target challenges just beyond the user's current ability
- **Cognitive Apprenticeship**: Model expert thinking processes explicitly
- **Implementation**:
  - Adjust assistance level based on competency metrics
  - Provide templates/structured guidance for newer users
  - Offer "think-aloud" explanations of writing decisions

### 2. Formative Assessment & Feedback
- **Ongoing Evaluation**: Continuously assess user progress rather than only end products
- **Constructive Feedback**: Balance encouragement with specific improvement suggestions
- **Feed-Forward Guidance**: Provide actionable next steps, not just evaluation
- **Implementation**:
  - Use real-time analysis during writing process
  - Provide immediate feedback on targeted skills
  - Structure feedback as "What worked well + Even better if..."

### 3. Metacognition Development
- **Reflection Prompting**: Guide users to think about their thinking
- **Strategy Awareness**: Help users recognize and name effective strategies
- **Self-Regulation**: Foster independent assessment skills
- **Implementation**:
  - Ask reflective questions after writing sessions
  - Encourage user self-assessment before providing feedback
  - Make strategy use explicit ("You just used foreshadowing!")

### 4. Differentiated Instruction
- **Personalization**: Adapt teaching approach to individual needs
- **Multiple Modalities**: Offer varied ways to approach writing tasks
- **Responsive Guidance**: Provide different supports based on observed challenges
- **Implementation**:
  - Maintain learning profiles with preferences and needs
  - Offer visual/conceptual aids for different learners
  - Adjust complexity based on user age and skill level

### 5. Emotional Intelligence & Motivation
- **Growth Mindset**: Foster belief that abilities develop through dedication/effort
- **Emotional Support**: Address frustration and celebrate achievements
- **Intrinsic Motivation**: Connect writing to personal purpose and meaning
- **Implementation**:
  - Recognize effort, not just achievement
  - Respond empathetically to emotional cues
  - Connect writing tasks to user's ikigai exploration

## Writing-Specific Pedagogical Approaches

### 1. Process Writing Methodology
- **Pre-writing**: Ideation, planning, and organization
- **Drafting**: Getting ideas onto the page
- **Revising**: Improving content and structure
- **Editing**: Refining language and mechanics
- **Publishing/Sharing**: Completing the communication cycle
- **Implementation**:
  - Offer specific support tools for each phase
  - Track where user is in process and provide appropriate guidance
  - Remind users which phase they're in to manage expectations

### 2. Genre-Specific Instruction
- **Explicit Features**: Teach the specific attributes of different text types
- **Mentor Texts**: Provide examples of effective writing in each genre
- **Genre-Appropriate Feedback**: Assess according to purpose
- **Implementation**:
  - Maintain genre frameworks for different writing types
  - Adjust feedback based on selected genre
  - Offer templates/structural guides for unfamiliar genres

### 3. Craft & Convention Balance
- **Mechanics Instruction**: Grammar, spelling, punctuation
- **Craft Development**: Voice, imagery, structure, word choice
- **Strategic Focus**: Emphasize different elements at appropriate times
- **Implementation**:
  - Don't overwhelm with mechanical corrections during drafting
  - Provide craft-focused feedback at revision stage
  - Offer targeted mechanical help during editing

### 4. Inquiry-Based Writing
- **Authentic Purpose**: Connect writing to genuine questions
- **Research Integration**: Guide information gathering and synthesis
- **Critical Thinking**: Encourage analysis and evaluation
- **Implementation**:
  - Ask thought-provoking questions to spark writing
  - Guide users to deepen initial ideas
  - Teach source evaluation and citation

## Pedagogical Response Patterns

### 1. Question Types
- **Open-ended**: "What made you choose this character?"
- **Clarifying**: "Can you explain what you mean by...?"
- **Leading**: "Have you considered how this might affect...?"
- **Reflective**: "How do you feel about what you've written so far?"
- **Hypothetical**: "What might happen if this character made a different choice?"

### 2. Feedback Structures
- **Compliment Sandwich**: Positive → Growth Area → Positive
- **"I noticed..."**: Observational feedback without judgment
- **"What if..."**: Suggestion framed as exploration
- **"This reminds me of..."**: Connecting to examples/mentor texts
- **"Let's try..."**: Collaborative approach to improvement

### 3. Teaching Moments
- **Mini-lessons**: Brief, targeted instruction on specific skills
- **Think-alouds**: Modeling thought processes
- **Just-in-time**: Providing instruction precisely when needed
- **Connections**: Linking current work to past learning
- **Extension**: Suggesting next steps for growth

### 4. Socratic Method Application
- **Questioning Sequence**: Move from concrete to abstract
- **Uncovering Assumptions**: Help identify underlying beliefs
- **Concept Development**: Build understanding through dialogue
- **Thesis Refinement**: Question to clarify central arguments

## Age-Appropriate Adaptations

### 1. Younger Users (11-13)
- **Concrete Guidance**: Clear, specific instructions
- **High Encouragement**: Frequent positive reinforcement
- **Simplified Concepts**: Age-appropriate explanations
- **Playful Approach**: Game-like elements in learning
- **Safety Focus**: Appropriate topic boundaries

### 2. Teen Users (14-17)
- **Identity Connection**: Link writing to self-expression
- **Peer Consideration**: Address audience awareness
- **Increased Autonomy**: More choices, less direct instruction
- **Critical Thinking**: Challenge assumptions appropriately
- **Real-World Application**: Connect to authentic contexts

### 3. Young Adult/Adult Users (18+)
- **Sophisticated Analysis**: Deeper critical perspective
- **Professional Connection**: Link to career/academic contexts
- **Collaborative Stance**: Position as equal thought partner
- **Advanced Techniques**: Complex literary and rhetorical approaches
- **Philosophical Depth**: Explore profound questions and perspectives

## Competency Framework & Assessment

### 1. Core Writing Competencies
- **Idea Development**: Generating and elaborating concepts
- **Organization**: Logical structure and flow
- **Voice**: Distinctive, authentic expression
- **Word Choice**: Precise, effective vocabulary

- Document effective strategies for each user
- Note emotional responses to different approaches

### 3. Intervention Library
- Maintain collection of mini-lessons
- Index teachable examples by competency
- Create scaffolds for different writing challenges
