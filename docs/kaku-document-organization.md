## File Naming Conventions

For better consistency, I recommend these naming conventions:

1. Use kebab-case for all filenames (words separated by hyphens)
2. Keep filenames descriptive but concise
3. Avoid dates in filenames when possible (use git for versioning)
4. Use consistent terminology across filenames

## Implementation Plan for Document Organization

### Phase 1: Essential Reorganization
1. Create the directory structure if it doesn't exist
2. Move existing files to their appropriate locations
3. Rename files for consistency
4. Update the main README.md with links to key documents

### Phase 2: Document Updates
1. Review and update outdated documents
2. Consolidate redundant information (e.g., multiple status documents)
3. Ensure cross-references between documents are correct

### Phase 3: New Document Integration
1. Add all new documents to appropriate folders
2. Ensure consistent formatting and style across documents
3. Update document reference guide with final locations

## GitHub Integration Considerations

1. **Git Tracking**: Ensure .md files are properly tracked in git
2. **README References**: Update the main README.md to point to the document structure
3. **Link Structure**: Use relative links between documents that work in both GitHub and local viewing
4. **GitHub Pages**: Consider enabling GitHub Pages for better documentation browsing if appropriate

## Document Management Best Practices

1. **Version Control**: Use git commits with meaningful messages for document changes
2. **Cross-References**: When referencing other documents, use relative links
3. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent formatting across all documentation
4. **Regular Updates**: Schedule periodic reviews of documentation to keep it current
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure documents follow markdown best practices for readability
