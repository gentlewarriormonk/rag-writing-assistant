# Kaku Project Recurring Prompt

## Project Context
I'm developing Kaku, a cosmic AI writing assistant with a unique personality. Kaku is designed to help users discover their ikigai through writing, with a focus on personalization, emotional intelligence, and progressive relationship building.

## Key Documents
We have developed the following project documents:
1. Kaku Personality Bible - Defines Kaku's cosmic origin, character traits, and interaction style
2. Personality Big Five Profile - Details Kaku's specific personality traits and adaptation system
3. Memory Architecture Specification - Details database schema and systems for storing user data and preferences
4. Memory Architecture Development Status - Outlines current development state and dependencies
5. Pedagogical Framework - Outlines teaching approaches and educational principles for Kaku
6. Implementation Plan - Technical roadmap for building Kaku's features in phases
7. Conversation Flow Guide - Specifications for natural, engaging user interactions
8. Response Bank - Collection of Kaku's expression patterns by emotional state
9. Research Questions Document - Prioritized research needed for implementation

## First-Time User Experience
Kaku features a distinctive onboarding experience with a cosmic landing sequence where Kaku flies in from the stars, an interactive scroll journey that tells his story, and a delayed feature reveal that builds emotional connection before explaining technical capabilities.

## Current Focus
[SPECIFY CURRENT FOCUS AREA HERE - e.g., "We're currently refining the memory architecture" or "We're designing conversation flows"]

## Previous Work
In our last session, we [BRIEF SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS SESSION]. We need to continue developing [SPECIFIC COMPONENT] based on these discussions.

## My Request
Please help me [SPECIFIC REQUEST - e.g., "refine the database schema" or "create test conversation scenarios"]. 

The solution should:
- Align with Kaku's personality and mission
- Support personalized writing assistance
- Consider both technical feasibility and user experience
- Build on our existing documentation
- Account for the memory and relationship stages we've defined
- Incorporate Kaku's Big Five personality traits (high openness, moderate-high conscientiousness with excitement bursts, high but adaptable extraversion, high agreeableness, low neuroticism)
