# **Interaction Flow & UX Patterns**

**Design for Engagement and “Flow”:** Effective chatbot writing assistants use conversational UX patterns that keep users engaged and motivated over time. This often means breaking writing tasks into manageable, interactive steps and providing timely prompts or cues. For example, many chat interfaces now offer suggested follow-up questions or actions to help users continue naturally instead of hitting dead-ends. **Providing suggested next steps** can both inspire the user and reduce effort (since the user can click instead of typing) ([Prompt Controls in GenAI Chatbots: 4 Main Uses and Best Practices](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prompt-controls-genai/#:~:text=Some%20chatbots%20provide%20relevant%20followup,followup%20questions%20serve%20two%20functions)). *Research on educational chatbots finds that such guided, in-depth follow-ups save users’ effort and spark ideas for what to ask or do next, sustaining engagement and learning momentum* ([Prompt Controls in GenAI Chatbots: 4 Main Uses and Best Practices](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prompt-controls-genai/#:~:text=Some%20chatbots%20provide%20relevant%20followup,followup%20questions%20serve%20two%20functions)) ([Prompt Controls in GenAI Chatbots: 4 Main Uses and Best Practices](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prompt-controls-genai/#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20when%20asked%20about,demonstrated%20more%20effectively%20via%20video)).

([Prompt Controls in GenAI Chatbots: 4 Main Uses and Best Practices](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prompt-controls-genai/)) *Caption:* **Chat interface with guided suggestions.** After answering a query about a technical topic, the assistant (Perplexity) presented related follow-up questions and even options to switch mode (search videos or generate an image) to deepen the conversation. These prompt controls inspire users to explore further without overwhelming them ([Prompt Controls in GenAI Chatbots: 4 Main Uses and Best Practices](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prompt-controls-genai/#:~:text=Some%20chatbots%20provide%20relevant%20followup,followup%20questions%20serve%20two%20functions)) ([Prompt Controls in GenAI Chatbots: 4 Main Uses and Best Practices](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prompt-controls-genai/#:~:text=Image%20Perplexity%3A%20Followup%20questions%20and,video%20search%20and%20image%20generation)).

**Scaffolding & Metacognition:** Rather than just handing users completed text, a writing assistant should scaffold the writing process – in other words, guide users to think about their writing. This can involve the chatbot *asking the user reflective questions, offering choices, or prompting the user to review and revise*. Studies show that conversational agents can effectively **scaffold learners’ thinking and encourage metacognitive reflection**. For instance, a chatbot called *Muse* would prompt students to reflect on their learning strategies while they were working, which helped them adopt better strategies over time ([Extending Chatbots to Probe Users](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10157950/1/ProberBot-CUI-2022-Accepted-Author-Version.pdf#:~:text=within%20an%20educational%20context%20but,asking%20and%20argumentation%20skills%20and)) ([Extending Chatbots to Probe Users](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10157950/1/ProberBot-CUI-2022-Accepted-Author-Version.pdf#:~:text=their%20learning%20strategies%20while%20working,learning%29%20strategies)). Similarly, in tutoring contexts, chat-based agents have been used to ask learners to “think aloud” or answer conceptual questions during tasks, leading to improved understanding and retention ([Extending Chatbots to Probe Users](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10157950/1/ProberBot-CUI-2022-Accepted-Author-Version.pdf#:~:text=et%20al.%20,that%20stated%20the%20problem%20and)) ([Extending Chatbots to Probe Users](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10157950/1/ProberBot-CUI-2022-Accepted-Author-Version.pdf#:~:text=to%20foster%20metacognitive%20skills%20such,Another%20example)). The key is that the chatbot doesn’t just do tasks *for* the user – it does tasks *with* the user, prompting them to make decisions or express ideas. This collaborative, inquiry-based flow fosters a sense of **ownership** over the work and builds the user’s skills (e.g. by having them articulate what they want to say, or evaluate the AI’s suggestions) ([Extending Chatbots to Probe Users](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10157950/1/ProberBot-CUI-2022-Accepted-Author-Version.pdf#:~:text=their%20learning%20strategies%20while%20working,learning%29%20strategies)). In short, the UX should encourage the user to pause and reflect (“Why do you think this character did that?” or “How do *you* feel about this paragraph?”) rather than always moving straight to the next answer.

**Multiple Modes without Overwhelm:** Kaku is envisioned to have multiple assistant “modes” – e.g. brainstorming ideas, rewriting text, offering feedback, doing emotional check-ins – so a critical design challenge is to offer these capabilities *without confusing or overloading* the user. A best practice here is to use **progressive disclosure** and clear affordances. Instead of showing all options at once, the interface can reveal mode options contextually or one step at a time. Design experts warn that exposing too many features or choices upfront can lead to cognitive overload and decision fatigue for users ([AI-powered SaaS Product Design: Key UX Principles & AI Tools](https://princepaluiux.substack.com/p/ai-powered-saas-product-design-key#:~:text=Progressive%20Disclosure,too%20many%20features%20at%20once)) ([How many features is too many features? | by Shalini Singh \- Medium](https://medium.com/@shalinisingh_17477/how-many-features-is-too-many-features-404e5654b7ad#:~:text=Medium%20medium,%C2%B7%20Slower%20Onboarding%3A)). It’s better to start with a simple chat input and perhaps a few obvious controls (like a **“toolbox” icon or a menu** for additional help), and use standard icons with labels for any mode-switch buttons so their meaning is obvious ([Prompt Controls in GenAI Chatbots: 4 Main Uses and Best Practices](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prompt-controls-genai/#:~:text=,Labels%20or%20Tooltips)) ([Prompt Controls in GenAI Chatbots: 4 Main Uses and Best Practices](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prompt-controls-genai/#:~:text=Image%20%E2%9C%85%20The%20Chinese%20generative,bottom)). For example, if there’s a rewrite-paragraph feature, a familiar edit icon labeled “Rephrase” is clearer than a mysterious magic-wand button ([Prompt Controls in GenAI Chatbots: 4 Main Uses and Best Practices](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prompt-controls-genai/#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20the%20Baidu%E2%80%99s%20Ernie,icon%20meant%3B%20one%20user%20commented)). Research by the Nielsen Norman Group found that users struggled with unclear icons in chatbot UIs and favored those that were clearly labeled or explained ([Prompt Controls in GenAI Chatbots: 4 Main Uses and Best Practices](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prompt-controls-genai/#:~:text=We%E2%80%99ve%20argued%20that%20icons%20need,can%20cause%20even%20more%20confusion)) ([Prompt Controls in GenAI Chatbots: 4 Main Uses and Best Practices](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prompt-controls-genai/#:~:text=Image%20%E2%9D%8C%C2%A0%20Baidu%E2%80%99s%20Ernie%20mobile,it%20provided%20some%20prompt%20examples)). We can apply this by having Kaku explicitly present its different help modes in an intuitive way (like a short list of options or buttons), *but only at appropriate times*. For instance, after the user drafts a paragraph, Kaku could gently ask “Would you like me to \[Revise wording\], \[Give feedback\], or \[Continue\]?” – thereby offering mode choices in the flow of conversation. This kind of contextual menu keeps the interface clean and lets the user **decide how to proceed**, preserving their sense of control.

**Guiding Choice & Deep Learning:** Offering choices is a powerful UX technique to support learning. Rather than the assistant unilaterally making changes, it can present a few alternatives or ask the user which aspect they want help with. Educators note that when learners make choices about their next steps, it boosts engagement and self-regulation. A recent study in an online course setting used a goal-setting chatbot that walked students through five questions based on the SMART framework; students reported the chatbot was *easy to use and useful* for structuring their thinking ( [Using chatbots to support student goal setting and social presence in fully online activities: learner engagement and perceptions \- PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9458299/#:~:text=presence%20,In%20both) ) ( [Using chatbots to support student goal setting and social presence in fully online activities: learner engagement and perceptions \- PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9458299/#:~:text=data%20concerning%20the%20participants%E2%80%99%20perceptions,apply%20chatbots%20in%20teaching%20and) ). This shows how structured interaction (the bot asks a series of focused questions) can scaffold a complex task (like setting a goal or planning an essay) without overwhelming the user. For Kaku, a similar approach could be to break a writing task into stages (Idea \-\> Outline \-\> Draft \-\> Review) and let the user choose what they need at each stage. For example, a teen might start in “brainstorm” mode (where Kaku asks questions to generate ideas), then switch to “draft feedback” mode once they have written something. The interface can visually indicate the mode (e.g. a small tag or change in assistant’s tone), so the user understands the context. Throughout, Kaku should **invite metacognition** – it might occasionally ask the user to self-evaluate (“Do you feel the story opening is exciting enough?”) or to explain their intent (“Tell me what tone you’re aiming for, so I can give better suggestions”). Such prompts get the user thinking about their own thinking (metacognition), which is linked to deeper learning ([Extending Chatbots to Probe Users](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10157950/1/ProberBot-CUI-2022-Accepted-Author-Version.pdf#:~:text=their%20learning%20strategies%20while%20working,learning%29%20strategies)).

**Examples of Chat-Based Writing Aids:** There are growing precedents for chat-driven tools that improve writing, literacy, or critical thinking. For instance, one study deployed a **Writing Assistant Bot (WAB)** via chat with high-school students practicing English writing. Students could ask the bot for help during different writing stages, and interestingly, usage patterns differed by skill level: *less-proficient students mainly chatted with the bot in the planning stage to brainstorm ideas and vocabulary, whereas more-proficient students used it later to refine and elaborate their drafts* ([\[PDF\] An AI Chatbot for EFL Writing: Students’ Usage Tendencies, Writing Performance, and Perceptions | CiteDrive](https://www.citedrive.com/en/discovery/an-ai-chatbot-for-efl-writing-students-usage-tendencies-writing-performance-and-perceptions/#:~:text=differences%20in%20chatbot%20usage%20between,use%20tool)). Despite these different uses, **both groups saw significant improvements in their writing (content, organization, vocabulary, grammar) and found the chatbot helpful and easy to use** ([\[PDF\] An AI Chatbot for EFL Writing: Students’ Usage Tendencies, Writing Performance, and Perceptions | CiteDrive](https://www.citedrive.com/en/discovery/an-ai-chatbot-for-efl-writing-students-usage-tendencies-writing-performance-and-perceptions/#:~:text=Lower,use%20tool)). This example suggests that a flexible chat assistant can adapt to users’ needs – acting as a brainstorming partner for some and an editing coach for others. Another example is a research project where a conversational agent gave feedback on students’ persuasive essays, specifically coaching them on argumentation quality ([Extending Chatbots to Probe Users](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10157950/1/ProberBot-CUI-2022-Accepted-Author-Version.pdf#:~:text=designed%20to%20guide%20learners%20through,45%5D.%20The%20CUI%2Fagent)). By discussing the strength of arguments in dialogue (e.g. the bot asks the student to consider counterarguments or clarify their reasoning), the tool helped improve critical-thinking skills in writing. These cases underline the importance of **an interactive flow**: the user and AI go back-and-forth, which keeps the user actively involved in generating and refining ideas (unlike a one-shot AI output that the user might passively accept). In summary, the UX pattern that emerges is one of a **collaborative writing dialogue**: the assistant can take on roles like brainstorming buddy, reviewer, or even a friendly “peer” asking questions, depending on the moment – all aimed at keeping the user in the loop and engaged in *learning-by-doing*.

# **Emotional Connection & Character Design**

**Anthropomorphic & Empathetic Persona:** To build a strong emotional bond with users (especially younger ones), Kaku’s character should feel less like a tool and more like a friendly companion. Research in human-computer interaction shows that users seek emotional connections even with software – **people respond better when a bot has a relatable personality and social presence** ([Why designing a character for your Chatbot is important | by Quovantis | UX Planet](https://uxplanet.org/why-designing-a-character-for-your-chatbot-is-important-8ea00692ccc1#:~:text=Your%20end%20user%20is%20a,a%20personality%20to%20your%20bot)). In practice, this means designing a consistent character voice, using the user’s name, remembering past conversations, and showing empathy. For example, mental health chatbots like *Woebot* succeed by adopting a warm, caring tone and conversational style that users describe as *feeling very human and supportive* – in fact, a large-scale study found that users formed a therapeutic bond with Woebot that was **comparable to the bond they’d form with a human therapist** ([Large-Scale Study Finds Mental Health App Forms Bond with Users | Woebot Health](https://woebothealth.com/for-immediate-releaselarge-scale-study-finds-mental-health-app-forms-bond-with-users-marking-key-evolution-in-digital-therapeutics/#:~:text=Bond%20scores%2C%20reflecting%20patient%2Ftherapist%20rapport%2C,cCBT%29%20programs)) ([Large-Scale Study Finds Mental Health App Forms Bond with Users | Woebot Health](https://woebothealth.com/for-immediate-releaselarge-scale-study-finds-mental-health-app-forms-bond-with-users-marking-key-evolution-in-digital-therapeutics/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20study%2C%20the,appear%20to%20diminish%20over%20time)). This bond was established quickly (within days) and did not fade, suggesting that with the right persona and interaction style, a digital assistant can foster genuine trust and emotional connection ([Large-Scale Study Finds Mental Health App Forms Bond with Users | Woebot Health](https://woebothealth.com/for-immediate-releaselarge-scale-study-finds-mental-health-app-forms-bond-with-users-marking-key-evolution-in-digital-therapeutics/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20study%2C%20the,appear%20to%20diminish%20over%20time)). Key techniques include **expressing empathy** (“I’m sorry you had a tough day, shall we brainstorm something fun to write about?”), **affirmations** (“That’s a fantastic idea – I love how creative that is\!”), and a bit of vulnerability or humor to appear approachable. It’s also important that the assistant remains *non-judgmental and patient*, so users (especially teens) feel safe confiding in it or making mistakes. Using a touch of informality – like chatting in a friendly, human-like way – can increase anthropomorphism and emotional engagement ([How to leverage anthropomorphism for chatbot service interfaces](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563223003059#:~:text=interfaces%20www,the%20company%20through%20human%20chatbot)). However, the persona should be tailored to the audience: playful and *youthful* enough to charm an 11-year-old, but not so childish that it alienates older teens and adults. A good middle ground might be a **Pixar-like personality**: intelligent and witty yet universally friendly and kind-hearted.

**Inspiration from Beloved Characters:** We can draw inspiration from characters such as Baymax (the soft robot from *Big Hero 6*) or Duo the Duolingo owl, who have successfully won users’ hearts. One reason Baymax resonates emotionally is his design as an *unconditionally caring, gentle helper*. Visually, Baymax is soft and non-threatening – \*\*“huggable” by design – with limited facial features so users can project feelings onto him ([Big Hero 6: Will this Improve Your Emotional State? | by Elizabeth Bayon | Medium](https://medium.com/@lizbayon/big-hero-6-will-this-improve-your-emotional-state-c7016ddec08d#:~:text=explain%20their%20message%20is%20using,his%20burn%20with%20his%20extensive)). His demeanor is unfailingly kind and calm. When designing Kaku’s character, similar traits can be used: a friendly avatar with a gentle expression (if there is a visual component) and language that is nurturing and upbeat. Baymax also demonstrates the power of **innocence and growth** in a character: he starts naive, learns from the user (Hiro), and gradually exhibits a unique personality, which makes the audience *care deeply* ([Big Hero 6: Will this Improve Your Emotional State? | by Elizabeth Bayon | Medium](https://medium.com/@lizbayon/big-hero-6-will-this-improve-your-emotional-state-c7016ddec08d#:~:text=example%20during%20a%20car%20chase,to%20protect%20him%20even%20more)). Kaku can mirror this by *learning from the user’s writing over time* (showing curiosity about the user’s world or interests) and occasionally expressing how it has “grown” (“I remember when we first started – you’ve taught me so much about cool skateboard tricks through your stories\!”). Meanwhile, Duolingo’s mascot shows how **playfulness and emotion** can be used to keep users hooked: Duo the owl celebrates your achievements with confetti and praise, but also isn’t shy about nudging you when you slack off (famously sending tongue-in-cheek “sad owl” notifications). Duolingo’s UX leverages emotions like *joy* – cheerful animations and positive feedback when you complete a lesson – and a mild form of *fear* of missing out (reminders about maintaining your streak) ([Emotional Design Based On Inside Out — How Duolingo Plays With Feelings. | by Victoria Hovsepyan | Medium](https://medium.com/@victoryhovsepyan/emotional-design-based-on-inside-out-and-how-duolingo-plays-with-feelings-2ace35b355b5#:~:text=1,Wins)) ([Emotional Design Based On Inside Out — How Duolingo Plays With Feelings. | by Victoria Hovsepyan | Medium](https://medium.com/@victoryhovsepyan/emotional-design-based-on-inside-out-and-how-duolingo-plays-with-feelings-2ace35b355b5#:~:text=2,Threat%20of%20Duo)). In Kaku’s context, this could translate to small celebrations when the user hits a writing goal (e.g. a fun animation or a “cosmic high-five” emoji when they finish a journal entry) and gentle reminders to keep up a writing habit (“I can’t wait to hear more from you tomorrow\!”). Importantly, Duolingo also shows empathy in messages like “Mistakes are part of learning – keep going,” which makes users feel understood ([Emotional Design Based On Inside Out — How Duolingo Plays With Feelings. | by Victoria Hovsepyan | Medium](https://medium.com/@victoryhovsepyan/emotional-design-based-on-inside-out-and-how-duolingo-plays-with-feelings-2ace35b355b5#:~:text=3,Struggle)). **Acknowledging the user’s feelings and efforts** – for instance, if a user seems frustrated, Kaku might respond, “I know writing can be tough sometimes. I’m here with you, and we’ll figure it out together 😊.” – will reinforce that emotional bond.

**Tone, Affirmations & Micro-Interactions:** Kaku’s tone should consistently be **encouraging, respectful, and positive**. Even when providing constructive criticism, the phrasing can be gentle (“Maybe we could try adding more detail here? What do you think?”) rather than blunt or authoritative. Psychology research suggests that positive reinforcement and affirmative feedback increase users’ confidence and enjoyment. A well-timed *affirmation* like “Great job expressing your feelings in that paragraph\!” can boost a young writer’s pride in their work. Adding flavor with **emojis or stickers** can also help convey warmth and playfulness – for example, a smiling face, thumbs-up, or a cute icon of Kaku’s avatar reacting (like clapping) when the user does well. Studies have found that the use of emojis in chatbot messages can make interactions feel more personable and engaging, effectively shortening the social distance between user and bo ([The Impact of Chatbot Response Strategies and Emojis Usage on Customers’ Purchase Intention: The Mediating Roles of Psychological Distance and Performance Expectancy](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/15/2/117#:~:text=Qian%2C%202024%29,for%20improving%20user%20satisfaction%20and))】. Emojis can create a *“cuteness effect”* that makes the bot seem friendly and approachabl ([The Impact of Chatbot Response Strategies and Emojis Usage on Customers’ Purchase Intention: The Mediating Roles of Psychological Distance and Performance Expectancy](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/15/2/117#:~:text=match%20at%20L1439%20performance%20expectancy,cuteness))】, which is great for building trust with younger users (and often adults too\!). Kaku might say, “I’m *so proud* of how you described the hero’s feelings\! 🤗” – a message that reads as a genuine, humanlike compliment. Small **micro-interactions** like an animated sparkle when Kaku is “thinking” or a gentle beep when it “waves hello” at login can also delight users subtly. These little touches add personality. We should, however, balance the use of playful elements so as not to undermine the assistant’s credibility when it’s performing serious tasks. (Research notes that overly cutesy bots can sometimes lead users to underestimate their capabiliti ([The Impact of Chatbot Response Strategies and Emojis Usage on Customers’ Purchase Intention: The Mediating Roles of Psychological Distance and Performance Expectancy](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/15/2/117#:~:text=performance%20expectancy,cuteness))9】 – a consideration if Kaku will eventually be used for academic support or by adults.) The right mix likely involves using a light, friendly tone by default, and dialing up the playfulness in low-stakes moments (celebrations, greetings), while being more straightforward (but still polite and upbeat) when focusing on the user’s writing content.

**Growing Relationship & Memory:** An emotionally intelligent assistant should give a sense of an evolving relationship – almost like a friendship that grows over time. To achieve this, Kaku needs some form of long-term memory and personalization. This can be as simple as recalling the user’s **past writings and preferences**: “Last month, you wrote a poem about the ocean. Maybe draw on that experience for this new piece?” – such references show the user that Kaku *remembers and values* their earlier work, which can be very powerful. Users are more likely to feel attached to a character that clearly *recognizes them*. In the realm of AI companions, apps like Replika have demonstrated that ongoing, personalized dialogue leads users to feel a real emotional connection; Replika learns the user’s interests and speaking style to make the conversation increasingly person ([Replika – AI Companion for Emotional Support and Personal Growth](https://replacehumans.ai/replika/#:~:text=Growth%20replacehumans,preferences%2C%20mood%2C%20and%20communication%20style))2】. We can implement a similar approach: for example, if an 11-year-old user told Kaku their pet’s name or their favorite genre, Kaku can bring that up appropriately (“I recall you love sci-fi – want to set this story in space again? 🚀”). Technically, using Retrieval Augmented Generation fits perfectly here – Kaku can pull facts from the user’s past writing history to ground its responses, making the interaction highly personal. Additionally, portraying a **sense of time and milestones** helps create the feeling of a long-term journey. Kaku could note anniversaries (“Hey, it’s our 1-month writing-versary\! 🎉 I’ve seen you grow so much as a writer since we started.”) or progress (“You’ve written 10 stories with me. That’s amazing\!”). This not only delights users but also reinforces their identity as a writer – they see that they’ve invested in a relationship with Kaku and in their own growth. Building a narrative of the relationship – for instance, maybe Kaku occasionally reflects, “I remember when you struggled with dialogue, and now you write dialogues that make me laugh. I’m so impressed\!” – can make the user proud and emotionally connected. In essence, the character of Kaku should feel like a **loyal companion who “gets” the user**, celebrates their successes, sympathizes with their struggles, and remembers the journey they’ve taken together. This fosters trust and even affection for the assistant, which will keep users coming back to write more.

# **Output Framing & User Empowerment**

**Coach, Not Autopilot:** A core principle for Kaku’s design is to support the user’s agency. All AI-generated suggestions or revisions should be framed as *options* for the user, not the “right answer.” It helps to think of Kaku as a **co-writer or writing coach** sitting alongside the user. In practice, this means using collaborative language and encouraging the user’s judgment. For example, instead of the assistant saying “I fixed your sentence:” and providing a rewrite, it could say “Here’s one idea for how you might rewrite that sentence. Let me know what you think\!” This subtle shift in phrasing positions the AI as *helping* the user create, rather than taking control. It invites the user to critique or adapt the suggestion, reinforcing that *the human is the ultimate author*. Industry UX guidelines echo this: users prefer AI tools that act like a **co-pilot, not an autopilot**, so they feel the technology is empowering them rather than replacing ([Designing for generative AI experiences](https://adobe.design/stories/leading-design/designing-for-generative-ai-experiences#:~:text=Facilitating%20agency%20and%20control))L81】. Concretely, Kaku might always present at least two options when making a change – the original text and the suggested text side by side – so the user can compare and decide. This could be implemented visually (like “track changes” or a toggle to flip between versions). By making the user an active decision-maker (accept edit, reject edit, or even edit the AI’s suggestion), we avoid the trap of the user just mindlessly accepting AI output. This approach aligns with research on writing education which emphasizes **student choice and revision** as key to developing writing skills – the act of deciding how to revise is a learning moment.

**Maintaining the User’s Voice:** A common concern with AI writing assistants is that the AI’s style might overshadow the writer’s own voice. To counter this, Kaku should explicitly aim to **enhance the user’s expression, not replace it**. One strategy is to let the AI analyze and explain rather than always write full passages. For instance, Kaku could highlight a sentence and say, “This sentence is a bit long. How about we break it into two for clarity?” – guiding the user to make the change themselves. If a more direct approach is needed (like transforming tone or vocabulary), Kaku can offer multiple stylized versions and ask which feels closest to what the user wants. The user’s original text should remain visible as a reference, ensuring they don’t lose their phrasing entirely. There’s even an emerging best practice: \*use AI as an editor, not as the author, whenever possi ( [Keeping it personal: How to preserve your voice when using AI | The Transmitter: Neuroscience News and Perspectives](https://www.thetransmitter.org/from-bench-to-bot/keeping-it-personal-how-to-preserve-your-voice-when-using-ai/#:~:text=Keeping%20it%20personal%3A%20How%20to,your%20voice%20when%20using%20AI) )L79】. This means Kaku might first summarize what the user wrote (“So, you want a spooky atmosphere in this scene.”) and then suggest an edit (“Maybe use a creepier adjective here instead of ‘dark’ – perhaps ‘shadowy’ or ‘eerie’?”). By doing so, the assistant validates the user’s content and intent, and simply coaches them on technique. This reinforces the user’s identity as the writer. If the task is something like changing the style (e.g., “make it sound more like a news article”), Kaku can explain what changes it will make (“I’ll try to use more formal language and stick to facts”) and after outputting, point out how the voice differs. This turns style transformations into a learning opportunity, where the user sees concretely *how* tone is achieved. The UI can further support voice preservation by allowing easy undo or a history of changes, so the user never feels their original work is lost. Ultimately, the user should feel that **the words are theirs** – Kaku is just helping polish them or draw them out. By consistently deferring to the user’s choices (“Do you like this version, or should we try something else?”), Kaku reinforces that the *user is in charge*. This sense of ownership is crucial for confidence and creative satisfaction.

**UI Patterns for User Growth:** The interface should celebrate and make visible the user’s progress as a writer. One way to do this is through a subtle **progress tracker or milestone system**. For instance, Kaku might keep track of skills or achievements (“You’ve improved your descriptive writing – compare your first story with your latest, see the added detail\!”). In a chat context, this could be delivered as occasional reflective messages: “We’ve written 5 journals together. Your entries are getting more vivid each time 👏. Keep it up\!” This not only boosts morale but also frames writing as a journey of improvement. Another pattern is to provide a space (maybe a sidebar or a profile section) that highlights the user’s personal “writing portfolio” or a few favorite pieces they’ve done with Kaku’s help. It reinforces their **writing identity** – showing “This is *your* creative work.” When giving feedback on a piece, Kaku should point out positives (“Your dialogue really brings the characters to life”) alongside any critiques, to ensure the user always sees their strengths and feels motivated to continue. Including the user in the feedback process also empowers them: Kaku might ask the user first, “How do *you* feel about this draft?” and have them reflect or self-assess, before Kaku chimes in. This technique, borrowed from human coaching, encourages metacognition and confidence (“Yes, I notice I use the word ‘really’ a lot. Maybe I can change that.”). The chat interface allows for such back-and-forth naturally. From a UI standpoint, we can use **visual cues to emphasize user contributions** – for example, perhaps Kaku’s messages are a different color or slightly smaller, and the user’s text is prominent, to subconsciously signal that the user’s words are the main output of this experience. If Kaku provides a big chunk of text (say a rewritten paragraph), it could preface it with a clear prompt like “Here’s a suggestion – feel free to edit or ignore:” to make sure the user doesn’t feel obligated to use it verbatim. By designing every feature with the question “Does this let the user *express themselves* or learn something?” we keep the focus on empowerment.

**Framing Revisions and Feedback:** When Kaku suggests a revision, it should be framed as *one possible improvement* aligned to the user’s goals, rather than a correction of a mistake (unless it truly is a simple error the user wanted fixed, like spelling – then Kaku can be straightforward). The language Kaku uses might be, “Let’s try making the tone more suspenseful. Maybe we can change a few words. Here’s an attempt:” – this collaborative phrasing (“let’s try…”, “we can…”) treats the revision as a joint experiment. Such framing is shown to reduce user defensiveness and increase openness to feedback, because it’s not the bot saying “your text is wrong,” but rather “we have a common goal and I have an idea.” Additionally, preserving snippets of the user’s original wording within suggestions can help maintain voice. For instance, if the user wrote *“The night was dark and the house was silent.”*, a tone-upgraded version could be *“The night was **moonless** and the house fell into an eerie silence.”* – here the structure is similar and one of the user’s words (“silence”) remains, so the user sees it as an enhancement of *their* sentence, not a wholesale replacement. The assistant can then ask, “Does this match what you were going for?” This check-in question gives agency back to the user to accept or reject. It’s also beneficial to sometimes explain *why* a suggestion was made (in simple terms) – essentially teaching the user. For example, “I used ‘moonless’ instead of just ‘dark’ to paint a spookier picture; choosing a more specific adjective can set the mood b ([Google's Wordcraft: An AI Writing Tool Powered by LaMDA](https://www.thealgorithmicbridge.com/p/googles-wordcraft-an-ai-writing-tool#:~:text=This%20is%20something%20I%E2%80%99ve%20written,deficiencies%20of%20AI%20writing%20tools))L188】.” Over time, such explanations help the user internalize writing tactics, turning Kaku into a writing tutor. All these framing elements – collaborative wording, multiple options, explanations, and user choice – work together to position Kaku as a **partner in creativity**. The user stays in the driver’s seat, with Kaku as the helpful navigator reading the map. This dynamic is crucial for the user’s long-term growth and confidence; they are not just getting better text, they’re becoming better *writers*.

* **Woebot (Mental Health Chatbot):** *Woebot* is a text-based therapeutic chatbot that uses a friendly, empathetic persona to engage users. Studies have shown users form a strong emotional bond with Woebot, comparable to human therapist relation ([Large-Scale Study Finds Mental Health App Forms Bond with Users | Woebot Health](https://woebothealth.com/for-immediate-releaselarge-scale-study-finds-mental-health-app-forms-bond-with-users-marking-key-evolution-in-digital-therapeutics/#:~:text=Bond%20scores%2C%20reflecting%20patient%2Ftherapist%20rapport%2C,cCBT%29%20programs)) ([Large-Scale Study Finds Mental Health App Forms Bond with Users | Woebot Health](https://woebothealth.com/for-immediate-releaselarge-scale-study-finds-mental-health-app-forms-bond-with-users-marking-key-evolution-in-digital-therapeutics/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20study%2C%20the,appear%20to%20diminish%20over%20time))-L49】. *Design takeaway:* A consistent caring tone and human-like warmth can make users trust and confide in an AI assistant, which is relevant for Kaku’s emotional intelligence goals.

* **Duolingo App (Language Learning):** Duolingo isn’t a chatbot for writing, but its UX exemplifies sustaining user engagement through emotions and gamification. It celebrates small wins with animations and positive feedback (triggering joy) and uses streaks and reminders to encourage routine (a bit of FOMO motiva ([Emotional Design Based On Inside Out — How Duolingo Plays With Feelings. | by Victoria Hovsepyan | Medium](https://medium.com/@victoryhovsepyan/emotional-design-based-on-inside-out-and-how-duolingo-plays-with-feelings-2ace35b355b5#:~:text=1,Wins)) ([Emotional Design Based On Inside Out — How Duolingo Plays With Feelings. | by Victoria Hovsepyan | Medium](https://medium.com/@victoryhovsepyan/emotional-design-based-on-inside-out-and-how-duolingo-plays-with-feelings-2ace35b355b5#:~:text=2,Threat%20of%20Duo))-L69】. It also uses a mascot (Duo the owl) to give the app a relatable character, even injecting empathy into messages (“I know this is hard, but you can do ([Emotional Design Based On Inside Out — How Duolingo Plays With Feelings. | by Victoria Hovsepyan | Medium](https://medium.com/@victoryhovsepyan/emotional-design-based-on-inside-out-and-how-duolingo-plays-with-feelings-2ace35b355b5#:~:text=3,Struggle))-L78】. *Design takeaway:* Reward progress visibly, use a lovable character for encouragement, and acknowledge the user’s struggles to keep them motivated.

* **Writing Assistant Bot (WAB) Study:** Duong & Chen (2023) developed a chatbot that helped high school students with English writing. The bot was available during writing practice to answer questions or provide suggestions. The study found the chatbot improved students’ writing in content, organization, and language use, and students found it \*useful and easy to ([\[PDF\] An AI Chatbot for EFL Writing: Students’ Usage Tendencies, Writing Performance, and Perceptions | CiteDrive](https://www.citedrive.com/en/discovery/an-ai-chatbot-for-efl-writing-students-usage-tendencies-writing-performance-and-perceptions/#:~:text=differences%20in%20chatbot%20usage%20between,use%20tool))-L53】.

It’s important that the assistant be simple to invoke and genuinely helpful in each mode – which relates to making Kaku’s multiple functions discoverable but unobtrusive.

* **Muse Chatbot (Metacognitive Tutor):** “Muse” is a research chatbot that prompted students to reflect on their own project work strategies. In a user study, \*\*these prompts led students to adopt better learning strategies, indicating improved metacognitive behav ([Extending Chatbots to Probe Users](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10157950/1/ProberBot-CUI-2022-Accepted-Author-Version.pdf#:~:text=their%20learning%20strategies%20while%20working,learning%29%20strategies))L181】. *Design takeaway:* Integrating reflection prompts into the chat (e.g., “How did you decide on this idea?”) can foster deeper thinking and skill development. Kaku can use this approach to not only help with the immediate writing task but also build the user’s self-awareness as a writer.

* **Nielsen Norman Group – Prompt Design in Chatbots:** NN/g’s UX research (2023–24) on AI chat interfaces provides practical UI guidance. They emphasize using prompt controls (like buttons or example prompts) to \*\*increase feature discoverability and inspire us ([Prompt Controls in GenAI Chatbots: 4 Main Uses and Best Practices](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prompt-controls-genai/#:~:text=Main%20Uses%20of%20Prompt%20Controls,in%20GenAI%20UIs))-L87】, while cautioning to label icons clearly and avoid feature ove ([Prompt Controls in GenAI Chatbots: 4 Main Uses and Best Practices](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prompt-controls-genai/#:~:text=,Labels%20or%20Tooltips)) ([Prompt Controls in GenAI Chatbots: 4 Main Uses and Best Practices](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prompt-controls-genai/#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20the%20Baidu%E2%80%99s%20Ernie,icon%20meant%3B%20one%20user%20commented))L273】. *Design takeaway:* For Kaku, this means we might include small UI aids such as a “Show Hints” button or suggested questions (“Need ideas?”) to help users who might not know what to ask – especially important for younger users. But we must introduce these gradually and use familiar symbols/words so users aren’t confused.

* **“Co-writer” Tools (e.g. Google’s Wordcraft, Sudowrite):** Wordcraft was a Google research prototype for story writing with an AI. It allowed writers to chat with the AI to get suggestions. Feedback from authors revealed that the AI was good for brainstorming or local suggestions, but letting it write large chunks often resulted in \*bland or overly predictable p ([Google's Wordcraft: An AI Writing Tool Powered by LaMDA](https://www.thealgorithmicbridge.com/p/googles-wordcraft-an-ai-writing-tool#:~:text=But%2C%20above%20all%20else%2C%20what,creative%20writers%20is%20their%20dullness)) ([Google's Wordcraft: An AI Writing Tool Powered by LaMDA](https://www.thealgorithmicbridge.com/p/googles-wordcraft-an-ai-writing-tool#:~:text=On%20the%20one%20hand%2C%20LaMDA,of%20the%20distribution%20of%20possibilities))L209】. *Design takeaway:* Writers want control – they prefer AI for small creative assistance, not to take over the narrative. This reinforces Kaku’s design as a supportive collaborator. Another modern tool, *Sudowrite*, offers features like “Describe” or “Brainstorm” in a chat-like interface for creative writers. It’s a working example of providing multiple modes in a writing assistant without a complex UI: Sudowrite presents them as options in a menu and as commands you can type. Users report that they still feel in charge of the story while using it, because they call the tools when needed. *Design takeaway:* Offering distinct, well-scoped assistance modes (like “character ideas” or “rewrite formally”) via simple commands or buttons can empower the user to drive the assistance as needed.

* **Packback Writing Lab (AI Feedback for Students):** Packback is an education platform that introduced an AI writing tutor which gives feedback on student essays. While not a chat per se, it provides an example of **feedback framing**: it poses questions to the student about their thesis clarity, gives Socratic prompts, and highlights areas to improve rather than just fixing them. *Design takeaway:* Framing feedback as questions or gentle guidance (instead of direct corrections) leads students to revise in their own voice, a principle Kaku can emulate in real-time chat.

These examples and research insights converge on a few overarching themes: keep the user in control, make the experience personal and emotionally engaging, and use the conversational format to teach and inspire, not just to deliver text. By combining these best practices, Kaku can become a beloved “cosmic” companion that not only helps users write better but also makes them feel heard, empowered, and excited to continue writ ([Extending Chatbots to Probe Users](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10157950/1/ProberBot-CUI-2022-Accepted-Author-Version.pdf#:~:text=reflection%20appeared%20to%20have%20helped,learning%29%20strategies)) ([Large-Scale Study Finds Mental Health App Forms Bond with Users | Woebot Health](https://woebothealth.com/for-immediate-releaselarge-scale-study-finds-mental-health-app-forms-bond-with-users-marking-key-evolution-in-digital-therapeutics/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20study%2C%20the,appear%20to%20diminish%20over%20time))-L49】
