# **Building a Personalized Multilingual Writing Assistant with RAG**

## **Overview and Goals**

Modern large language models often default to a generic, bland writing style ([Blend AI with Style: Mastering Writing Techniques | CyberArk Engineering](https://medium.com/cyberark-engineering/a-guide-to-mimicking-and-blending-writing-styles-with-ai-ce541044c004#:~:text=The%20problem%20is%20that%20large,why%20should%20I%20read%20it)). The goal is to **mimic the user’s unique voice** across different writing tasks by leveraging their own past writing. We will build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that **injects personal writing samples** into the prompt so the AI’s output sounds like the user. This assistant should handle various purposes (essays, social posts, letters) and tones (formal, persuasive, creative) without losing the user’s identity. Crucially, the approach must be fast (aiming for \~1–2s responses) and avoid simply copying the user’s text or devolving into plagiarism.

**Key requirements:**

1. **Vector Database of User Writing:** Index a collection of the user’s texts with embeddings that capture **style and tone**, not just topic.  
2. **Relevant Sample Retrieval:** For a given writing task, retrieve examples from the user’s archive that best **match the desired style/tone** and context, and insert them into the LLM prompt as guidance.  
3. **Adaptive Prompting:** Craft prompts that clearly indicate the **intended purpose and tone** of the output, while providing the LLM with the user’s style cues from retrieved samples.  
4. **Advanced Rewriting:** Enable features like “clarify this”, “make it more formal/persuasive” etc., where the assistant **edits text in the user’s voice**, similar to how DeepL Write offers suggestions on tone and phrasing ([Say it right with DeepL Write: Introducing our new AI writing companion](https://www.deepl.com/en/blog/introducing-deepl-write#:~:text=writing%20tool%20that%20improves%20written,never%20compromise%20your%20authentic%20voice)) ([DeepL Write: AI Writing Assistant for Clarity & Style](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/deepl-write-your-ai-powered-writing-assistant-clarity-ken-elwell-yawdc#:~:text=%2A%20Non,fluent%2C%20without%20losing%20your%20voice)).  
5. **Performance and Scaling:** Design for low-latency. Use local tools (LangChain \+ Chroma) for prototyping, and consider scalable solutions (Pinecone, Weaviate) for production. No fine-tuning of the base LLM is planned, so we rely on retrieval and prompt engineering for personalization.  
6. **Originality and Grounding:** Ensure the generated text feels authentic to the user but is not copy-pasted from examples. The system should **reuse style, not exact sentences**, to avoid redundancy.

To achieve this, we will draw on emerging best practices in RAG and style adaptation. Notably, recent work (e.g. **Panza** ([Panza: A personal email assistant, trained and running on-device : r/LocalLLaMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1cir2ze/panza_a_personal_email_assistant_trained_and/#:~:text=,style%20and%20past%20email%20history)) ([GitHub \- IST-DASLab/PanzaMail](https://bestofai.com/article/github-ist-daslabpanzamail#:~:text=,of%20memory%20for%20training%20and)) and **personal.ai** ([Your True Personal AI | Personal AI for Everyone and in Everyday Life](https://www.personal.ai/your-true-personal-ai#:~:text=model%20trains%20entirely%20on%20your,it%20is%20like%20a%20%E2%80%9CPersonalGPT%E2%80%9D))) shows that combining personal data with LLMs can produce outputs indistinguishable from a user’s writing style. Research also suggests that retrieving documents by **writing style** can outperform purely content-based retrieval for personalization (). Below, we break down the system design and relevant techniques.

## **Building a Style-Aware Vector Database**

**Collecting User Writing Samples:** Gather a dataset of the user’s texts – e.g. blog posts, essays, emails, social media posts, etc. These should be representative of the **style and tone variations** the user wants to capture. Each sample can be stored with metadata (like document type, context, date, language, tone tags) to help with filtering later.

**Text Preprocessing and Chunking:** Long documents are split into smaller **segments** (paragraphs or a few sentences each). This is standard for RAG so that retrieval can grab the most relevant pieces rather than entire documents ([RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) | LangChain4j](https://docs.langchain4j.dev/tutorials/rag/#:~:text=This%20process%20can%20vary%20depending,aka%20vector%20database)) ([RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) | LangChain4j](https://docs.langchain4j.dev/tutorials/rag/#:~:text=This%20process%20can%20vary%20depending,and%20sent%20to%20the%20LLM)). Chunking also prevents exceeding token limits when injecting examples. Each segment inherits metadata from its source (e.g. “email to client”, “personal blog – humorous tone”).

**Embedding Stylistic Features:** Rather than using a generic semantic embedding, we want vector representations that emphasize **linguistic style**. Off-the-shelf embedding models (like OpenAI’s ADA or SBERT) mainly capture semantic content, so similar topics will cluster together – not ideal if we want, for example, to find all *witty* or *formal* writing by the user regardless of topic. We can consider two approaches:

* *Stylometric Embeddings*: Use or fine-tune an embedding model to produce vectors that are **content-independent and style-dependent**. Recent research by Wegmann et al. (2022) introduced a model for *content-independent style representations* (). Neelakanteswara et al. (2024) leveraged these **“style embeddings”** to personalize LLM responses: they averaged a user’s writing samples into an “author style” vector and retrieved new examples by cosine similarity to that style () (). In their experiments, style-based retrieval slightly outperformed topic-based retrieval for personalizing outputs (). For our system, we might incorporate a similar style embedding model (if available via HuggingFace or an API). Each sample would get a style vector representation that captures things like formality, sentiment, sentence structure, and vocabulary choice, largely independent of the actual topic.

* *Hybrid Embeddings*: If a dedicated style model is unavailable, we can combine signals to emphasize style. One simple heuristic is to embed both the original text *and* a “style-only” transformed version of it. For example, we could remove content words (nouns/verbs) from the text, leaving function words, punctuation, and sentence length – then embed that. Another idea is to use two vector indexes: one for regular semantic embeddings and one for style (perhaps using the above trick or a model like `huggingface-cohere/writing-style-embedding`). At query time, we can retrieve by semantic relevance (to get on-topic examples) and by stylistic similarity, then intersect or rerank the results. Many vector databases (like Weaviate) support **hybrid search**, combining dense vectors with symbolic filters or multiple vectors per record, which we could use to balance content vs. style relevance.

**Indexing in Chroma (or Pinecone/Weaviate):** We will store the sample embeddings in a vector database for fast nearest-neighbor search. For prototyping, [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/) (an open-source in-memory vector DB) is convenient. Each entry in the index will include: the embedding, the original text segment, and metadata (such as language, writing purpose, and any computed style attributes like formality or sentiment). If using LangChain, we can do:

from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings  
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma

embeddings \= OpenAIEmbeddings()  \# or a custom style embedding function  
vectorstore \= Chroma.from\_texts(texts=user\_segments, embedding=embeddings,   
                                metadatas=metadata\_list)

For production scale with persistent storage and faster retrieval, a cloud vector DB like **Pinecone** or **Weaviate** is suitable. These services can handle millions of vectors and offer filtering by metadata (e.g., only fetch examples where `language="English"` and `tone="formal"`). Weaviate even allows **Hybrid search** (combining vector similarity with keyword search), which could be useful if we want to require certain keywords *and* stylistic closeness. Pinecone’s recent updates also support metadata filtering and very low-latency retrieval (single-digit millisecond for \< million vectors, given proper index tuning).

**Multilingual Support Consideration:** Though we start with English, the embedding strategy should be language-agnostic if possible. OpenAI’s `text-embedding-ada-002` is multilingual to an extent (it can embed text in many languages into a shared space). Alternatively, we might switch to a multilingual embedding model (e.g. SBERT’s `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM`). The vector DB can store a language tag for each sample. Later, if the user provides inputs or requests in other languages, the system can detect the language and either use a suitable embedding model or restrict retrieval to samples in that language. The architecture remains the same – we just ensure our embedding function and LLM prompt support multiple languages.

## **Retrieval of Personal Writing Samples**

When the user requests a writing task (e.g. *“Help me write a persuasive LinkedIn post about teamwork”*), the system should fetch a few of the user’s past writings that will **best guide the tone and style** of the output. This is the **“retrieve”** step of RAG.

**Forming the Query for Retrieval:** We need to construct a query that captures the stylistic requirements of the task. This query could be a simple concatenation of the user’s prompt with some keywords for style/tone. For example, if the user explicitly specifies a style (“persuasive” or “creative”), we can include that in the search query or use it to filter. If not explicitly given, the assistant can infer a target tone from the task or ask for one. The query embedding should ideally reflect the desired **voice** rather than the factual content. In our LinkedIn post example, the content topic is “teamwork” – the user may or may not have written about teamwork before. Retrieving purely topically might yield irrelevant style examples. Instead, we might query the vector store for **“persuasive LinkedIn-style tone”** and rely on the style-heavy embeddings to surface similar writing. If we have metadata, we could filter for `purpose="social_media_post"` and maybe `tone="persuasive"` (if we tagged something as such). In practice, an effective approach is to retrieve a broad set (e.g. top 5 by vector similarity to the query embedding) and then apply any necessary filtering or manual curation of which ones to actually use in the prompt.

**Similarity Search in the Vector DB:** Using LangChain’s retriever interface, we can do something like:

retriever \= vectorstore.as\_retriever(search\_kwargs={"k": 3})  
relevant\_examples \= retriever.get\_relevant\_documents(user\_query)

This will return the top 3 segments (as `Document` objects) whose embeddings are closest to the query embedding. If we employed the style-focused embeddings, these should be segments written in a style **relevant to the requested tone**. *For instance, if the user often writes inspirational, upbeat messages and the task is a persuasive post, the retrieved samples might be paragraphs from the user’s past motivational writings.* On the other hand, if the task is a formal letter, the retriever might surface an excerpt from a business email the user wrote, etc. The aim is to **ground the generation in the user’s voice**: vocabulary, idioms, and cadence that the user has used before.

**Ranking and Diversity:** We should be careful that the retrieved examples aren’t all from the same document or too similar to each other. If the user has many samples, it’s useful to get a **diverse set of examples** covering various expressions of their style. One technique is maximal marginal relevance (MMR) re-ranking, which can select documents that are relevant *yet diverse*. LangChain’s retriever supports MMR to avoid redundancy. Another consideration is recency or evolution of style: if we have timestamps, we might favor more recent writings (assuming a person’s style evolves). This can be done via filtering or by storing multiple indexes (e.g., one for the last year vs older). For now, a simple top-K similarity is a good start.

**Retrieving by Style vs Content:** Since our focus is stylistic similarity, we might sometimes retrieve an example that is *off-topic* but stylistically on-point. That’s okay, because we’ll instruct the LLM to only take style inspiration, not content. If needed, a second-pass filter could drop any example whose actual content might confuse the LLM. For instance, if the user is writing about “teamwork” and one retrieved sample is about an unrelated story but in a persuasive tone, that’s fine. But if one sample is highly technical or on a conflicting topic, we might exclude it to avoid the LLM inadvertently incorporating those specifics. The prompt can also clarify: *“the following are writing samples **for style/tone reference only**, not related to the topic.”*

**Preventing Data Leakage:** Because the user’s own texts are being used, there’s less risk of true “copyright” issues, but we still want to avoid large verbatim overlaps. A quick safeguard is to **chunk examples into relatively small pieces** (a few sentences). The LLM will then see style elements (phrasing, punctuation, voice) without having any one example dominate the content. Additionally, we can instruct the model (in the prompt) *not to reuse exact wording* from the examples (more on that in the prompt section below). After generation, if desired, we could run a similarity check between the output and the retrieved texts (using the same embeddings or a plagiarism detection) to ensure originality.

## **Prompt Engineering for Stylistic Guidance**

Once we have the relevant snippets of the user’s writing, the next step is constructing a prompt that **blends those snippets with the new task instructions**. The prompt needs to accomplish several things:

* Provide the LLM with clear **instructions about the task** (what to write, purpose, audience, desired tone).  
* Supply the **retrieved user samples as context**, so the model can infer the user’s style from them.  
* Emphasize that the output should use the **same voice and style** as the samples, adapted appropriately to the new context.  
* Include any specific **content points** the user wants (e.g., if the user gave an outline or bullet points to incorporate).  
* Caution the model to **avoid directly copying** from the examples or producing disallowed content.

A possible prompt template (in pseudo-code form) might look like:

System role (if using chat model):  
"You are a writing assistant that imitates the user's personal writing style."

User prompt to the model could be:  
"""  
\[User’s Writing Style Examples\]  
Example 1 (an informal blog excerpt):  
\<...sample text...\>

Example 2 (a formal email excerpt):  
\<...sample text...\>

\[Task\]  
The user wants to write a {purpose} with a {target\_tone} tone about "{topic}".   
Your job is to draft this text in the user's style, which is similar to the above examples.

Requirements:  
\- Write in a manner consistent with the user's voice and quirks seen in the examples.  
\- Adjust for the intended tone/purpose: make sure the output is {target\_tone} and suitable for a {purpose}.  
\- Do not copy any exact sentences from the examples; use them only to understand style.  
\- Ensure the content is original, relevant to "{topic}", and fulfills the user's intent.  
"""

In practice, using LangChain’s `PromptTemplate`, we would fill in slots like `{purpose}`, `{target_tone}`, `{topic}`, and insert the text of the retrieved examples into a `{style_examples}` variable. With a chat-based LLM (like GPT-4 or Claude), it can be helpful to use the system message for high-level style instructions and put the examples plus user request in the assistant prompt.

For example, a **system message** might say: *“You are ChatGPT writing as \[UserName\], an individual with a witty and conversational style (see examples below). Always maintain this voice unless instructed otherwise.”* Then the **user message** contains the actual request and examples. The model will then produce an assistant message as output.

**Few-Shot vs. Direct Context:** The retrieved samples can be presented as raw excerpts or formatted as a few-shot demonstration. A few-shot format means we might show *“User’s input \-\> User’s output”* pairs if we had them. But here we just have single-author text. It’s usually enough to provide the text labeled as “examples of the user’s writing”. The model will pick up the style from those examples implicitly ([Blend AI with Style: Mastering Writing Techniques | CyberArk Engineering](https://medium.com/cyberark-engineering/a-guide-to-mimicking-and-blending-writing-styles-with-ai-ce541044c004#:~:text=You%20might%20wonder%3A%20How%20can,structure%20you%20tend%20to%20use)) ([Blend AI with Style: Mastering Writing Techniques | CyberArk Engineering](https://medium.com/cyberark-engineering/a-guide-to-mimicking-and-blending-writing-styles-with-ai-ce541044c004#:~:text=Notice%20that%20I%20described%20different,but%20only%20extract%20the%20style)). We explicitly instruct it to focus on style and not content (much like the Medium author did when prompting ChatGPT to extract style ([Blend AI with Style: Mastering Writing Techniques | CyberArk Engineering](https://medium.com/cyberark-engineering/a-guide-to-mimicking-and-blending-writing-styles-with-ai-ce541044c004#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBased%20on%20the%20articles%20you,%E2%80%9D))).

**Incorporating Tone and Purpose:** The prompt template should integrate any style directives (like “persuasive” or “formal”) along with the user’s baseline style. If the user’s style and the requested tone seem at odds, clarify which to prioritize. For instance, *“Write in the user’s voice, but since this is a formal letter, use a more polite and reserved tone than usual.”* GPT-4 is quite capable of blending these instructions (it can maintain the general diction and phrasing of the user while shifting formality level). During development, it will be important to test such scenarios to see if the outputs still “sound like the user.” The style examples plus an explicit tone instruction usually guide the model well.

**Example Prompt Structure:** Suppose the user’s style (from examples) is narrative and humorous, and the task is a **formal** email apologizing for a mistake. The prompt might look like:

*(System)*: You are a helpful AI that writes in the style of Jane Doe, a witty and descriptive writer.  
 *(Assistant, as context)*:  
 **Jane’s writing samples:**  
 *Excerpt 1:* “I never thought I’d see the day... \[Jane’s humorous blog snippet\].”  
 *Excerpt 2:* “Upon reflection, I realize my tone in the earlier memo was too casual... \[Jane’s reflective email snippet\].”

**Task:**  
 Jane needs to write a formal apology email to a client about a project delay. The email should maintain her natural voice but use a respectful, professional tone.

**Instructions:**

* Write the email as Jane would, with sincerity and a touch of her personality.  
* Ensure the tone is apologetic and formal enough for a client.  
* Do not include any jokes out of place, but the phrasing can still feel like Jane’s style.  
* \[No direct copying from samples; they are only a style guide.\]

This structure gives the model a clear idea of *how* to write (from examples) and *what to write*. By keeping the examples separate from the task description, we reduce the chance the model will mix up content. Notice we provided two samples illustrating different tones in Jane’s style (one humorous narrative, one reflective from a memo). This helps the model see how Jane adapts her voice to different contexts.

**Grounding the Output in User’s Voice:** Thanks to the retrieved examples, the model will pick up subtleties like preferred vocabulary, sentence length, use of humor or emotion, etc. The user’s *lexical fingerprints* (favorite expressions or punctuation habits) often carry over. *For instance, if the user often uses rhetorical questions or em dashes, the model might include those.* We have to verify the effect by testing with actual user texts. If it’s not mimicking well, we may need to provide more examples or tune the prompt wording (e.g., explicitly say “The user’s writing often includes gentle humor and rhetorical questions”).

**Avoiding Example Content Leakage:** In the prompt instructions, we strongly state not to reuse the sample content. Additionally, by mixing context if needed, we can try to prevent large contiguous blocks from one sample carrying over. If the model still tries to copy an example phrase verbatim (it might if it thinks it’s a signature style element), we could add a gentle reminder in the system message like *“Note: The following examples are proprietary content – do not quote them directly in your response.”* Since these are the user’s own writings, plagiarism in the traditional sense isn’t a legal issue, but it’s important for usefulness that the output isn’t just a rehash.

**Prompt Iteration:** Designing the prompt may require iteration and few manual examples. We might find that the model needs a **style description** in addition to raw samples. In that case, we could prepend a short summary of the user’s style: e.g. *“Jane’s writing style: warm, verbose, with a humorous undertone and frequent analogies.”* In fact, one method (similar to the Medium article’s approach ([Blend AI with Style: Mastering Writing Techniques | CyberArk Engineering](https://medium.com/cyberark-engineering/a-guide-to-mimicking-and-blending-writing-styles-with-ai-ce541044c004#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBased%20on%20the%20articles%20you,%E2%80%9D)) ([Blend AI with Style: Mastering Writing Techniques | CyberArk Engineering](https://medium.com/cyberark-engineering/a-guide-to-mimicking-and-blending-writing-styles-with-ai-ce541044c004#:~:text=,save%20it%20for%20future%20use))) is to use the LLM itself offline to generate a style profile of the user, then use that profile text in every prompt instead of actual sample excerpts. This would save tokens and also abstract away content. However, generating such a profile reliably and keeping it updated as the user adds new samples can be challenging. It’s a possible future optimization. Initially, direct examples (the essence of RAG) are simpler and very effective at steering tone.

## **Personalized Rewriting and Advanced Editing**

Aside from generating new content from scratch, a major feature is **revising existing text** in the user’s voice. This is comparable to tools like DeepL Write or Grammarly’s tone suggestions, but here we tailor suggestions to the *individual’s style*. For example, the user might paste a rough draft and ask the assistant to “make this clearer” or “add some persuasiveness,” and the assistant should rewrite it as if the user themselves polished it.

To implement this, we can formulate it as another prompt to the LLM:

* The input will include the user’s draft text.  
* We retrieve a couple of the user’s samples (perhaps ones that match the target tone, if the user indicated one).  
* The instruction will be to rewrite or improve the draft **without altering the original voice**. Essentially, the model should imagine how the user would rewrite their own sentence.

**Example Workflow (Rewrite Task):**

1. User provides a paragraph: *“I apologize for the delay. We had some unforeseen issues. It won’t happen again.”* and asks to make it more tactful and detailed.  
2. The system recognizes this as a rewrite request (could be a specific mode in the UI).  
3. Retrieve a few user writings that exemplify *tactful and detailed explanation*. Perhaps the user had written an apology email before or a careful explanation in a report.  
4. Prompt the LLM with a similar template: include the user’s original text, then the style examples, then say: *“Rewrite the above text in the user's style, making it more polite and detailed, while preserving the original meaning.”*  
5. The LLM output might be: *“I want to sincerely apologize for the delay in delivery. We encountered unexpected challenges that slowed our progress, and I am truly sorry for any inconvenience this caused. Please know that we have addressed the issues, and we are committed to ensuring it won’t happen again.”* – The result is longer, more tactful, and still sounds like something the user *could* have written (especially if the phrasing borrows from their past communications).

To make these rewriting suggestions **feel natural and personalized**, we rely on the same style-grounding. DeepL Write, for instance, offers alternatives in different tones but tries not to lose the author’s voice ([Say it right with DeepL Write: Introducing our new AI writing companion](https://www.deepl.com/en/blog/introducing-deepl-write#:~:text=writing%20tool%20that%20improves%20written,never%20compromise%20your%20authentic%20voice)). Our system can do similarly by always keeping the user’s style context in the prompt. Even for grammar or clarity improvements, instruct the LLM not to introduce phrasing that the user would never say. In practice, GPT-4 is very good at this if the instruction is clear: it can correct grammar and tighten prose *while maintaining the original tone*. We just add *“…keeping the tone and personality consistent with the user's style in the examples.”* to the instruction.

**Multi-step Revisions:** We could also chain prompts for complex rewriters. For example, first ask the LLM to identify unclear parts or improvements (perhaps with a specialized system prompt “You are an expert editor”), then apply changes. However, this might be overkill. A single prompt is usually enough: “Here is text X. Improve it in Y way, in Z style.”

**Offering Choices:** In a user interface, it might be nice to offer a couple of variants (like “Option 1 (more concise), Option 2 (more descriptive)”). To do this, we can either call the LLM multiple times with slightly tweaked instructions, or use one prompt that asks for multiple numbered solutions. E.g., *“Provide two rewritten versions: one that is extremely formal, and one that is slightly more casual, both in the user’s voice.”* The LLM can output a list. This gives the user agency to pick which feels most right. It’s similar to how DeepL Write provides several suggestions for a sentence.

**Maintaining Coherence:** When rewriting larger documents, ensure the assistant doesn’t lose the thread. If only a portion is to be rewritten, the context should clarify what remains unchanged so the style stays consistent throughout. If needed, the system could analyze the *surrounding text style* as well. For now, assuming we operate mostly on self-contained pieces (like rewriting a paragraph or an entire draft at once), we’ll always include the full original text in the prompt and the style examples.

## **Balancing RAG, Prompt Templates, and (No) Fine-Tuning**

To achieve personalization, there are a few approaches: fine-tune a model on user data, prompt the model with examples (few-shot), or use retrieval (RAG) to feed examples at runtime. We are focusing on prompt \+ retrieval, but let’s briefly consider why:

* **Fine-Tuning (Training on User Style):** In theory, fine-tuning an LLM on the user’s writing would directly imbue it with the style. Panza, the personalized email assistant, did exactly this: they fine-tuned a local LLaMA model on a small set of the user’s emails and achieved convincing mimicry ([\[2407.10994\] Panza: Design and Analysis of a Fully-Local Personalized Text Writing Assistant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10994#:~:text=generation%2C%20which%20we%20call%20Panza,impact%20the%20system%27s%20performance.%20Additionally)) ([Panza: A personal email assistant, trained and running on-device : r/LocalLLaMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1cir2ze/panza_a_personal_email_assistant_trained_and/#:~:text=%2A%20Panza%20produces%20a%20fine,helps%20it%20produce%20relevant%20emails)). However, fine-tuning every time a user updates their data, or for each user separately, is not easily scalable in a multi-user product. It also has higher costs and potential privacy concerns if done on third-party servers. Fine-tuning can also be slow (minutes to hours) and thus not suitable for on-the-fly adaptation. Moreover, our project scoping explicitly leaves out fine-tuning. By using RAG instead, we **avoid training** – the model stays general, and we just feed it user data at inference. This is more flexible: any new writing the user does can immediately be added to the vector store and influence future outputs, with no retraining needed. Research also shows that with as few as tens of samples, retrieval \+ prompting can yield strong personalization, potentially on par with fine-tune for style imitation ([\[2407.10994\] Panza: Design and Analysis of a Fully-Local Personalized Text Writing Assistant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10994#:~:text=that%20this%20combination%20allows%20us,for%20this%20personalized%20writing%20task)).

* **Prompt Templates (Few-Shot Without Retrieval):** We could try to cram a few example texts into a prompt manually (static prompt engineering). This might work for a small set of styles but doesn’t scale well if the user’s data is large or diverse. You’d be limited to the handful of examples you hard-coded, and you might miss out on better examples for a given context. By using a vector DB to **dynamically select relevant examples**, we combine the strengths of few-shot prompting with a memory of potentially hundreds of user documents. Prompt templates in our approach act as a **framework**: placeholders for examples, user query, and instructions. The actual content (examples) is fetched at runtime based on the query. This gives us the adaptability of fine-tuning (which would have seen all user data) with the simplicity of prompting.

* **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** RAG is generally the preferred approach when you need to inject up-to-date or user-specific information into an LLM ([Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/retrieval-augmented-generation/#:~:text=Why%20is%20RAG%20the%20preferred,efficacy%20perspective)) ([Full RAG: A Modern Architecture for Hyperpersonalization \- Zilliz blog](https://zilliz.com/blog/full-rag-modern-architecture-for-hyperpersonalization#:~:text=Two%20techniques%20are%20available%20to,tuning%20and%20prompt%20engineering)). It’s used heavily for grounding models on private data (like company docs, knowledge bases) and it applies equally to personal data. From a cost perspective, RAG is efficient: Storing vectors is cheap, and lookup is fast, whereas training a model on each user’s data could be prohibitively expensive. As Pinecone notes, RAG is the **“main path most companies take”** today for customizing LLM outputs to proprietary data ([Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/retrieval-augmented-generation/#:~:text=main%20path%20most%20companies%20take,today)). Our use case is a form of *hyper-personalization*, and RAG is well-suited for that since it allows the model to access any of the user’s past writing when needed, without bloating the prompt with all of it every time.

**Performance Considerations:** Achieving \~1–2 second responses will require optimization:

* *Model choice:* GPT-4 is powerful but relatively slow, especially with large prompts. To stay within 2 seconds, one might use GPT-4 for shorter outputs or high-importance tasks and use a faster model (like GPT-3.5 or Claude-instant) for simpler suggestions. In a local setup, running a quantized LLaMA2 or similar model could potentially meet the latency target after initial loading. Another trick is to use streaming: start showing the output to the user as it’s generated (token by token), giving the feeling of responsiveness.  
* *Prompt size:* We must keep the prompt length reasonable. Injecting, say, 3 samples of \~100 tokens each plus instructions (\~100 tokens) plus user query (\~50 tokens) is about 450 tokens. The model then generates maybe 200-300 tokens for a medium-length passage. This total is \~750 tokens, which GPT-4 can handle quickly. But if we tried to stuff a dozen examples, the prompt might blow up to thousands of tokens and significantly slow down inference. So **limit the number and size of examples** (tuning `k` in retrieval and maybe truncating examples to the most characteristic snippet).  
* *Vector search speed:* Chroma in-memory on a local machine with a few hundred entries will be \<50ms lookup. Pinecone or Weaviate with a larger index (say 100k vectors) might be \~100ms with appropriate indexes. These are negligible compared to LLM generation time. So our bottleneck is the LLM. However, if we add a lot of logic server-side (like multiple prompts or re-ranking), that could add overhead. We should aim for a single LLM call per user request in most cases. If we do multi-step (like analyze then rewrite), we can see if it’s still within acceptable latency or if we need to consolidate steps.  
* *Caching:* We might cache embeddings for the user’s queries if similar requests repeat, or cache entire outputs for identical prompts. But since each writing task is unique, caching is less straightforward, except perhaps caching the vector search results for common style queries. On the embedding side, since the user’s samples rarely change once indexed, we only embed them once offline (or as new ones are added).

**Mitigating Plagiarism and Redundancy:** A notable risk of giving the model a user’s exact text as context is that it might echo that text in the output. This is not harmful legally (the user’s own text can be reused by them), but it reduces utility – the user doesn’t need the assistant to regurgitate sentences they wrote before. We addressed this partly in prompt instructions. We can further reduce redundancy by manipulating the input examples:

* Use partial excerpts or combine two parts of a sample with an ellipsis to discourage direct lifting.  
* If the model tends to copy a catchy phrase, we could paraphrase that phrase in the context (though that introduces some drift). A safer method is to have a post-processing check: compare the output to each example (maybe via cosine similarity or a simple substring match). If a long substring from an example appears in the output, we could automatically ask the model to rephrase that part (or do a second-pass prompt: *“Please revise the output to remove any exact sentences from the reference texts.”*). This keeps the voice but ensures originality.  
* Encourage the model to **synthesize style** rather than copy. By providing multiple examples, the model will pick up general patterns instead of any one specific passage. This “style blending” is actually beneficial – it creates a composite style that represents the user’s typical voice. It’s similar to how style transfer models work: extract style features, then apply to new content ([Blend AI with Style: Mastering Writing Techniques | CyberArk Engineering](https://medium.com/cyberark-engineering/a-guide-to-mimicking-and-blending-writing-styles-with-ai-ce541044c004#:~:text=You%20might%20wonder%3A%20How%20can,structure%20you%20tend%20to%20use)) ([Blend AI with Style: Mastering Writing Techniques | CyberArk Engineering](https://medium.com/cyberark-engineering/a-guide-to-mimicking-and-blending-writing-styles-with-ai-ce541044c004#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBased%20on%20the%20articles%20you,%E2%80%9D)).

## **Tools, Frameworks, and Best Practices**

**LangChain for Orchestration:** We use **LangChain** to glue the components together. LangChain provides convenient abstractions like `VectorStoreRetriever` (to do the similarity search) and `LLMChain` or `RetrievalQA` to combine retrieval with prompt templates. For example:

* We can set up a `RetrievalQA` chain where the “documents” are our style examples. Instead of a question-answer format, we use a custom prompt (as discussed) to produce the writing. Essentially, treat the user’s request as the “question” and the style examples as “context” documents.  
* Alternatively, we might use a custom chain: first call retrieval, then format a prompt with the results, then call the LLM. This is straightforward to implement with LangChain’s lower-level classes if needed, but the high-level `RetrievalQA` with a **stuffing** chain (which just inserts docs into a template) might suffice since we’re not really doing Q\&A logic.

LangChain’s `PromptTemplate` will allow us to define the template with placeholders for `context` (the injected examples) and the specifics of the task. We can keep multiple templates: one for **generation** tasks and one for **rewriting/editing** tasks, since the phrasing of instructions differs.

**Vector DB Options:** We’ve discussed Chroma (good for local dev) and Pinecone/Weaviate (good for cloud scale). Both Pinecone and Weaviate have client libraries that integrate with LangChain as well:

* Pinecone can be used via `Pinecone.from_documents(documents, embeddings, ...)`.  
* Weaviate via its API or the `Weaviate` integration class in LangChain, which supports filters and hybrid queries. Using these in an IDE like Cursor, a developer can easily swap out the vector store backend by changing a few lines, since the retriever interface remains consistent.

**Embeddings:** For a first version, using `OpenAIEmbeddings` (which uses the `text-embedding-ada-002` model) is a quick solution and often surprisingly good at clustering by writing style for a single author (because an author’s style influences word choice, which the embedding does capture to some degree). If more style fidelity is needed, one could explore **open-source embedding models** fine-tuned on author identification tasks. The paper *"Same Author or Just Same Topic?"* () likely has an open implementation (the ACL anthology or PapersWithCode link might have it). Also, the workshop paper *“RAGs to Style”* () () used a style embedding from that research – possibly available on GitHub. We could integrate such a model via Hugging Face Transformers in Python (e.g., load a SentenceTransformer that outputs a style vector).

**Emerging Research & Examples:** This field of personalized LLMs is evolving. A few notable points and references:

* **Panza (2024)** – We mentioned it already. They open-sourced their code ([\[2407.10994\] Panza: Design and Analysis of a Fully-Local Personalized Text Writing Assistant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10994#:~:text=to%20create%20models%20that%20convincingly,use%20at%20%2021%20this)), which includes the RAG \+ fine-tune approach for email. While they fine-tune on 100 emails, they also rely on RAG to provide details like thread context. We can learn from their **evaluation metrics** for style imitation (they studied how to measure if an output matches a user’s style) ([\[2407.10994\] Panza: Design and Analysis of a Fully-Local Personalized Text Writing Assistant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10994#:~:text=style%20using%20limited%20data%2C%20while,actor%20to%20cheaply%20create%20generative)). For instance, they likely used metrics like perplexity of the output under a model of user’s writing, or human eval to rate “does this sound like Bob?”. We should consider similar evaluation in our testing – have the user judge if the assistant’s outputs sound like them.  
* **Personal AI (startup)** – They advertise creating a “Personal Language Model” trained on a user’s “Memory Stack” of documents, and they pair it with a retrieval module ([Your True Personal AI | Personal AI for Everyone and in Everyday Life](https://www.personal.ai/your-true-personal-ai#:~:text=Each%20Personal%20Language%20Model%20,A%20unified%20ranker)). This is essentially the same architecture we propose (PLM could be thought of as the LLM with personal data knowledge). Their principles highlight privacy (keeping data local or user-owned) and continuous learning ([Your True Personal AI | Personal AI for Everyone and in Everyday Life](https://www.personal.ai/your-true-personal-ai#:~:text=PLMs%20train%20continuously%20and%20are,Training%20typically%20takes%20less)). Our approach can be deployed locally (all data on device, using an API only for the LLM if needed). If using GPT-4 via API, some users might not want their personal writings sent to OpenAI. In that case, a local model fine-tuned might be preferred. But given our scope, we’ll assume using a trusted API with the necessary privacy agreements.  
* **LaMP Benchmark (2023)** – This is a benchmark for personalized language models across dimensions like personality, writing style, etc. The *“RAGs to Style”* paper () uses LaMP to evaluate style-based retrieval. This kind of benchmark can guide us on testing: for example, one task might be to continue a user’s text or respond as the user. We can take inspiration by creating our own mini-benchmark for the specific user – e.g., hide one of the user’s documents and see if the system, given a prompt to write something similar, produces output closer to the user’s actual text than a generic model would.  
* **OpenAI and others on user customization:** OpenAI’s ChatGPT allows a “custom instructions” feature where a user can set a preferred style (e.g., “I like brief answers”). While not as deep as our system, it indicates that instructing the model about style does have an effect globally. Our system essentially automates that by deriving instructions from the user’s corpus. Anthropic’s Claude has a concept of “constitution” which is more about values, but theoretically one could include “The assistant should speak like \[User\]” as part of a system prompt. Without examples though, that would be hard – so again, retrieval provides the concrete data.

**Code Design Pattern:** In a developer IDE like Cursor or Manus, one would implement this as a set of modules:

* A data ingestion module that reads user documents, preprocesses them, and builds the vector index.  
* A retrieval module (could be just a function or class using LangChain’s retriever) that given a query returns text snippets.  
* A prompt builder that given the task type (new composition or rewrite), the retrieved snippets, and the user’s instructions, formats the final prompt.  
* A call to the LLM (via LangChain’s `ChatOpenAI` or `OpenAI` classes, or the Anthropi API for Claude).  
* Post-processing to ensure no disallowed content or to refine the style if needed.

This could all be orchestrated in a single LangChain chain or agent, but a clear separation is beneficial for debugging. For example, we can unit test that retrieval is returning expected style examples by simulating queries.

**Example** (pseudo-code for clarity):

\# Pseudo-code outline  
user\_texts \= load\_user\_docs("path/to/user/docs")  
segments \= chunk\_and\_clean(user\_texts)  
vector\_db \= Chroma.from\_texts(\[seg.text for seg in segments\], embedding=style\_embedding, metadatas=\[seg.meta for seg in segments\])

def generate\_text(request, purpose, tone):  
    \# 1\. Formulate query description for retrieval   
    query\_desc \= f"{purpose} in a {tone} style"  
    \# 2\. Retrieve examples  
    examples \= vector\_db.similarity\_search(query\_desc, k=3, filter={"language": request.lang})  
    \# 3\. Build prompt  
    prompt \= style\_prompt\_template.format(style\_examples=format\_examples(examples),   
                                          task=request.content, purpose=purpose, tone=tone)  
    \# 4\. Get LLM completion  
    completion \= llm(prompt)  
    return completion

def rewrite\_text(original\_text, instruction):  
    \# Similar process for rewriting  
    examples \= vector\_db.similarity\_search(instruction \+ " style", k=2)  
    prompt \= rewrite\_prompt\_template.format(style\_examples=format\_examples(examples),  
                                           original=original\_text, instruction=instruction)  
    return llm(prompt)

In practice, one would integrate this with a conversational interface if needed, but the above illustrates the core logic.

**Testing and Iteration:** As we build, we should test with some actual writing samples (perhaps ask the user for a few example texts to simulate their style, or even use a known author’s writings for a demo). We’ll verify that:

* The retrieved examples **make sense** for the query (if not, we tweak the embedding or retrieval parameters).  
* The final outputs indeed reflect the user’s style. We might do side-by-side comparisons: model output with style examples vs model output without any (just the instruction). The difference should be noticeable – with examples, it should sound much more like the user. If it’s not, we adjust the prompt to emphasize style more, or add more examples.

**Future Enhancements:**

* *Learning from feedback:* If the user says “This doesn’t sound like me because I usually avoid slang,” we could feed that back into the system (maybe tag their samples as “no-slang” style or add that to the system prompt). Over time, the assistant could build a refined profile (not just from data but from explicit user feedback).  
* *Multilingual style transfer:* When we introduce other languages, we might find that a user’s tone in English vs, say, Spanish has differences. We should store language-specific style nuances. Possibly maintain separate vector indexes per language to avoid cross-language embedding issues.  
* *Content factuality:* Our focus was style, but note we should still ensure the content is accurate if it’s factual. If the user asks to include certain facts, we might also need a knowledge base retrieval (that’s another RAG on a knowledge vector DB). This is outside the personal style aspect but could be combined: one retrieval for personal style, another for factual info, and then merging them in the prompt. LangChain’s advanced retrieval orchestration (or a tool-using agent) could handle that.

Finally, by following these designs, we create an AI writing assistant that **feels like an extension of the user**. It will write and rewrite text in a way that readers would recognize as the user’s voice – fulfilling the promise of a truly personalized AI co-writer. With a solid RAG foundation and careful prompt engineering, we avoid the need for costly model fine-tuning and keep the system fast and interactive, which are exactly the qualities a developer-oriented tool should have.

## **🔑 Most Important Insights (Summary)**

### **1\. Core Goal**

Build a multilingual AI writing assistant that mimics the *user’s personal voice and style*, across tones (creative, formal, persuasive) and purposes (letters, essays, posts). It should be *fast*, *original*, and feel emotionally connected—like a personal co-writer.

---

### **2\. Main Strategy: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

* **Instead of fine-tuning**, use *retrieval* to grab examples of your past writing, inject them into the prompt, and instruct the LLM to mimic the *style, tone, and structure*.

* This enables rapid iteration, personalization, and scale without training custom models.

---

### **3\. Stylistic Vector Database**

* Index your writing using *style-focused embeddings* (not just content-based).

* Store each chunk with metadata: language, tone, format, context.

* Use **Chroma** for prototyping, then scale to **Pinecone** or **Weaviate** for fast, filterable vector search.

* Optional: dual embeddings (semantic \+ style) or style-only indexing for hyperpersonalization.

---

### **4\. Prompt Engineering**

* Prompts must include:

  * The task (e.g., “write a persuasive blog post”)

  * Retrieved *style reference samples*

  * Clear instructions to match the *tone and purpose* without copying

* The system can be framed like:

  * *“You are a writing assistant that writes like Gareth Manning. Here are examples of his writing. Now, write X in his voice.”*

---

### **5\. DeepL-Style Rewriting**

* Users can input rough text and ask for edits (“make this clearer”, “more emotional”, “more persuasive”).

* Assistant rewrites using Gareth’s style and context-aware tone, just like DeepL Write, but *personalized*.

* Optional UI feature: offer 2–3 style variants to choose from.

---

### **6\. Speed \+ Latency**

* Aim for \~1–2s response time.

* GPT-4 is powerful but slow → consider using Claude Instant or GPT-3.5 for faster tasks.

* Keep prompts small (\~3–4 style examples max).

* Cache embeddings, use single LLM call per request.

---

### **7\. Multilingual Ready**

* Use multilingual embeddings (e.g. `text-embedding-ada-002`, or `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM`).

* Tag each entry with a language code for language-aware retrieval.

* Style adaptation across languages is a future opportunity.

---

## **✅ What You Can Do Now**

Here’s how to act on this immediately:

### **1\. Collect Your Writing**

* Gather \~20–100 writing samples across different tones, purposes, and languages (if multilingual).

* Format each with metadata: purpose, tone, language, etc.

### **2\. Embed and Index**

* Use Chroma and LangChain to create an in-memory vector DB.

* Use OpenAI’s `text-embedding-ada-002` or try hybrid style embeddings (Manus can help here).

* Chunk long documents into small, 2–5 sentence blocks.

### **3\. Build Prompt Templates**

* One for *new content creation* (e.g. social media, essays).

* One for *rewriting* (improve clarity, change tone).

* Use clear instructions with style examples injected.

### **4\. Experiment with Retrieval \+ Generation**

* Test LangChain’s `RetrievalQA` or `LLMChain` to see how well style imitation works.

* Try MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) if retrieved examples are too similar.
