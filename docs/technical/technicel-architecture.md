# Technical Architecture & Security Document

## 1. Authentication Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. **Registration Process**
   - Simple email/password registration
   - Social login options (Google, GitHub) for reduced friction
   - Lightweight bot prevention (hidden form field)
   - One-click email verification link

2. **Login Process**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Reasonable access token lifetime (1 hour)
   - Longer-lived refresh tokens (30 days) with "Remember Me" option
   - Secure cookie storage
   - Basic rate limiting for failed attempts

3. **Session Management**
   - Background token refresh (invisible to user)
   - Simple logout procedure
   - Reasonable session duration
   - Optional suspicious activity notifications

### User Roles & Permissions
- **Anonymous**: Limited read access
- **User**: Standard access to own resources
- **Admin**: Full access to all resources and user management
- **API**: Limited machine-to-machine access

## 2. API Security Architecture

### API Protection Measures
- **Authentication**: JWT validation middleware
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control per endpoint
- **Rate Limiting**: Per user and per IP address
- **Input Validation**: Schema validation for all requests
- **Output Sanitization**: Safe data rendering

### API Security Headers
```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
```

## 3. Database Architecture

### Data Schema
```
Users {
  id: UUID (PK)
  email: String (unique, indexed)
  password_hash: String
  role: Enum [user, admin]
  last_login: Timestamp
  created_at: Timestamp
  updated_at: Timestamp
}

Sessions {
  id: UUID (PK)
  user_id: UUID (FK)
  refresh_token_hash: String
  expires_at: Timestamp
  device_info: JSON
  ip_address: String
}

// Additional schemas to be added based on app functionality
```

### Database Security
- Parameterized queries for all DB operations
- Encrypted sensitive fields at rest
- Row-level security policies
- Regular backup procedures
- Database access restricted to application service

## 4. Frontend Architecture

### State Management
- React Context API for global state
- JWT decode for user information
- Client-side permission checking

### Secure UI Patterns
- Form validation with immediate feedback
- No sensitive data in localStorage/sessionStorage
- Content Security Policy implementation
- XSS prevention through proper content escaping

## 5. Infrastructure Security

### Environment Configuration
- Separate dev/staging/production environments
- Environment variables for all secrets
- No hardcoded credentials
- HTTPS enforced on all environments

### Deployment Security
- CI/CD pipeline with security scanning
- Dependency vulnerability checking
- Docker container security scanning
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for consistent environments

## 6. Security Monitoring & Response

### Logging
- Centralized application logs
- Authentication events logging
- Failed login attempt tracking
- Suspicious activity alerting

### Incident Response
- Security incident response plan
- Contact points for security issues
- Vulnerability disclosure policy
- Regular security review schedule

## 7. Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection
- GDPR compliance measures
- Data minimization principles
- User data export capability
- Right to be forgotten implementation

### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance targets
- Accessible authentication flows
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation support

## 8. Development Security Practices

### Secure Coding Guidelines
- Input validation on all user inputs
- Output encoding for all dynamic content
- Safe dependency management
- Code review security checklist

### Testing Strategy
- Regular security testing
- Penetration testing schedule
- Automated security scanning
- Authentication flow testing
