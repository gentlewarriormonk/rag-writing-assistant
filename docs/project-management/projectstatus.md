- **Color Scheme:** White (#ffffff), Dark Blue (#0f172a), Blue (#0EA5E9), Teal (#06B6D4), Gray (#64748B)
- **Font:** Inter

## Current Progress

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Initial color scheme selection
- Basic architectural planning
- Documentation framework
- Security requirements analysis

### üîÑ In Progress
- Technical Architecture document
- PRD revision
- Implementation plan
- Authentication design

### ‚è±Ô∏è Not Started
- Project initialization
- Authentication implementation
- Feature development
- Security testing

## Critical Path Items

### üö® Immediate Priorities (Next 48 Hours)
1. Finalize Technical Architecture document
2. Initialize project with security configurations
3. Implement basic authentication structure
4. Set up security headers and HTTPS

### üî∂ Short-Term Priorities (Next Week)
1. Complete authentication implementation
2. Conduct initial security testing
3. Begin core feature development
4. Set up automated security scanning

### üî∑ Medium-Term Priorities (Next 2-4 Weeks)
1. Complete core features
2. Conduct comprehensive security audit
3. Optimize performance
4. Prepare for launch

## Security Status

### üîí Core Security Measures (UX-Friendly)
- None yet - in planning phase

### üö® Security Vulnerabilities
- None identified yet - pending security testing

### üîÑ Security Tasks In Progress
- Simple, user-friendly authentication flow
- Basic security headers configuration
- HTTPS setup planning
- Lightweight bot protection strategy

## Dependencies & Blockers

### External Dependencies
- Authentication provider selection
- API endpoints availability
- Third-party security services

### Current Blockers
- None at this time

## Next Implementation Steps (For Cursor)

### Immediate Actions
1. Initialize React project with TypeScript and security configurations
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app app-name --template typescript
   cd app-name
   npm install @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest
   ```

2. Set up security-focused ESLint configuration
   ```bash
   npm install eslint-plugin-security
   ```

3. Create authentication context scaffold
   ```typescript
   // src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx
   // Implementation details will be provided
   ```

4. Implement token management utilities
   ```typescript
   // src/utils/auth.ts
   // Implementation details will be provided
   ```

## Future Updates Tracking

This document will be continuously updated throughout the project lifecycle to maintain a clear overview of:
- Implementation progress
- Security status
- Outstanding tasks
- Identified vulnerabilities and mitigations

## Notes for Team

- All code must follow the security guidelines in the Technical Architecture document
- Authentication is the highest priority and must be implemented before feature work begins
- Report any security concerns immediately
- Document all security-related decisions and implementations
